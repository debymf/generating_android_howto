This is simply not accurate. I just did it this morning. To do so, begin with a starting point, then use a dropped pin to make a destination. Then instead of tapping \"Start\", tap \"Directions\", then the ellipsis at the top right. Then tap \"Add Stop\". Then tap on the \"Add Stop\" entry in the list of stops at the top of the screen. Then tap on \"Choose on Map\". The app then provides a map with a pin on it allowing the map to be moved until the pin sits where you want it to rest. Tap \"OK\" at the bottom and your second pin is now included in your directions.
