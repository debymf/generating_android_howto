I would like to see the data just for the performance, let alone build quality and software features which are both considered very subjective to the eye of the beholder. This article is, frankly, quite biased and full of claims that shows how much the author favors the LG G Pad 8.3. \"The fact that the G Pad packs only a 5-megapixel camera doesn t impact the quality of the shot in the slightest.\" The author just typed it was a mediocre rear-facing camera a few lines before, now he's contradicting himself by typing that it doesn't impact shots quality by the slightest? There are a few more statements that I could point out, but putting that aside, I hope that articles like this can be improved in quality in the future, especially for a tech-blog like MakeUseOf. P.S.: Giveaways are always awesome though~ Reply Kannon Y May 2, 2014 at 4:55 pm This is actually excellent criticism as those exact two points were ones that I agonized over. Thank you Joses for taking the time to write. If you have additional points that need revision, I would greatly appreciate your input. The Snapdragon 600 is basically a low-cost tablet chipset (which is also used in a few phones) which offers good performance. Its real world performance at FHD resolutions is good, but it's definitely not the best. I should have emphasized that what makes the G Pad such a great device is its multifunctionality (the IR transmitter + software suite), build quality and great value. Regarding the camera, I need to make it clearer that the new Google Camera app available in Android 4.4 allows for surprisingly good shots to be taken, despite the weak 5MP camera. When time permits, I'll make those changes. Thanks again for the feedback! Reply Joses L May 3, 2014 at 3:12 pm I see, but your statement there sounds like it is the best tablet ever made in 2013 and 2014 regardless of price target market, which is of course far from the case. I would also like to point out that even the software feature doesn't seem all that great, those points that you made were: - Tablet Optimized Soft Keyboard, yet it didn't feature swyping, which is built-in for standard Android Keyboard from Jelly Bean onwards. The only difference is the number row, which, again, can be input from standard Android Keyboard anyway. - KnockON: This is a good feature, but it's not exclusive to LG, since some devices from the Xperia line also has tap2wake implemented. - Voice Mate: Google Now>Siri, so if Voice Mate<Siri, then it's obviously a failure and just another gimmick from LG... - Quicl Remote: Not enough info, but seems to simplistic to \"exceed all comptet. Which reinforces my point about how the G Pad isn't anything special at all, but IMHO still good enough for its price point(and this should be emphasized more). And I don't know why you would put plastic as better than metal. \"Normally metal components of tablets serve as heat sinks, but the G Pad uses the plastic as its primary place to transfer thermal energy.\" \" For example, after extended periods of gaming, the tablet only becomes warm to the touch. Its coolness owes in part to the aluminum backing, which doubles as a heat sink for the torrid Snapdragon 600 chipset.\" Another contradiction there, you said the G Pad primarily uses plastic to conduct heat, but then again say it can stay cool because of the aluminium back? I don't think there is any kind of plastic that is more conductive to aluminium, even thermally conductive polymer(although not sure about this one), but clearly aluminium conducts heat better than your average plastic. It worries me if a writer in a well-known blog site like MakeUseOf needs a reader to point out some obvious logical flaws in the written article. Where is the editor for this kind of thing? And even without a separate editor, I wonder if the writer is truly qualified to write about tech in MUO at all. Or if the writer doesn't really care because this is just a giveaway, and most people is just eager to get the stuff(which is largely true...). No offense there, and it's too late to change most of the stuff anyway.

Reply Oldgit9 April 29, 2014 at 3:34 pm I replaced a damaged Nexus 7 (2012) (damaged USB port) with this G Pad. It's a lot better IMO . The only downside I find, is u can't lock the home etc buttons when you have the keyboard up and it's too easy to accidentally press one if the buttons and exit what your doing. Other than that, I'm very pleased with it. 8/10 for me. Reply Irma T.

Reply Joseph G April 29, 2014 at 3:22 pm Whenever I'm in the market for a tablet, I tend to look at hardware spec first and then I like to analyse the tablet to see how the OS and other included bits of software take advantage of it.
