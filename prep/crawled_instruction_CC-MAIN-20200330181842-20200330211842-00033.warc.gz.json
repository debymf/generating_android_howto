Sure, it costs almost nothing (approximately $1.5 for 6 months), but it does feel weird. You can try the app for three days before purchasing the subscription. You can t start a conversation with a new contact, or start a new group. For that, you ll need to rely on your phone. WhatsRemote does not show you media inline. Instead, you get links, which you open in a new tab. By default, what you see on WhatsRemote is not marked as read in the WhatsApp app on your phone. So if you want to let your friends know you ve seen their messages, open the WhatsRemote Android app and tap the mark all read button.", "url": "https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-use-whatsapp-pc-sync-phone/", "index": 0}
