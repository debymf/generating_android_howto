If not already installed, add the desired channel app to your Roku TV's home menu. Install the matching mobile app on your phone or tablet. Launch the app on your mobile device. However, you do not need to open the matching streaming channel on your Roku TV. Tap the casting icon from inside the mobile app (usually displayed on the top right corner). With some apps, the casting icon may not appear until you begin playback on your mobile device. With casting, only the chosen content shows on your TV screen (no phone menu bars or status icons). From the list of available devices on your phone or tablet, tap your Roku TV. Playback of the casted content will begin. However, casting channels that support user profiles (such as Netflix) may require that you select your profile with your Roku TV remote before playback will begin.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/jailbreaking-roku-tv-4175402", "index": 0}
