Adios Reply Leo April 18, 2018 at 1:52 am I hard bricked my Huawei P10 VTR-L09 by trying to flash an update through TWRP, I ended up deleting my \"system\" database by mistake and had not made a backup. It is totally my own mistake, but now my phone is wiped clean and I would like to use it for software development but Huawei have their way of making bricked phones unusable. Reply Kavish Bansal April 21, 2019 at 1:25 am How did you do it, even I flashed wromg TWRP I think, but now it is stuck on first boot screen. PC doesn't recognises it, and can't get into any recovery modes listed. Please help. Reply Phone Phreak April 16, 2018 at 6:47 am There really is no such thing as a \"Soft Brick\" , its known as a boot loop and you can always get your phone into download mode at this point in time so its not really a brick yet, when you have bricked your phone its dead and I mean dead, its mostly caused by flashing a wrong boot loader and the phone has no way to even turn on so you now have a bricked phone. Some phones like Samsung use a usb dongle (jig) to get into download mode (hardware feature built in) so you can flash the proper firmware and the phone comes back to life, if you have a hardware failure then your not going anywhere so its now a expensive paper weight for your desk. Hardware failures are less common than a brick compared to them damn boot loops when flashing custom roms.

Reply Abhishek Alexander October 19, 2017 at 8:03 pm hi, my Lava Iris x1 grand phone is soft brick .i have custom recovery . so,how to flash stock framware rom ? Reply KONDANI Sukumar September 26, 2017 at 1:26 pm Hlo. I firstly used TWRP 3.0.2-2 . And istalled AOSP for my Lenovo k3 note. As it had some bugs I thought to flash Super RR custom rom by Jdesing. I tried to flash the rom through the same version of twrp recovery. Error 7 occurred. I searched on Google about error 7 and I came to know it happens because of fake version of TWRP. So again backup my previous data and installed Flashify app and flashed TWRP 3.1. and it prompted for 'Flashing Complete' 'reboot'. I rebooted. And its stuck in bootlooping. And as for my fate, I didn't enable USB Debugging before doing all that. Can anyone please tell me what to do now?

Just flash stock rom with odin(choose scatter file only preloader in download mode 1st)usb work back. After that flash again all file without preloader. Again, flash again whole file scatter will revive your phone. Now your phone imei and wifi not working. Google nvram or .... For solution.

However, when I tried to flash linux.img using TWRP, the phone phone went into a bootloop (I guess). Now, the phone keeps flashing the screen light and immediately attempts reboot.

Reply Sean January 16, 2017 at 2:39 pm Although it was awful at the time, I've hard-bricked a Nexus 4. Was playing around with some kernel tweaks that weren't compatible with my kernel. Phone suddenly shut off and refused to power back on. I knew it was all over when the charging LED went out. Kinda glad that device is gone though - needed a new battery and overheated very badly (like 90 degrees badly). I'm much more educated now, and enjoying my Nexus 5X.

I have an OTA update file but from about a full week of research and scouring all the sites its a huge mystery how to fix this. I had TWRP on it and rooted but as I said it just boots to the HP powered by android screen and stays. Every once in a while it reboots on its own and back to the for mentioned screen. HELP!!! PLEASE!!!! Reply Vladimir August 23, 2016 at 10:00 pm Yep, I've hard-bricked mine (LG L5 E610) after a couple of unsuccessful flashes of some of the CMs (probably just bad versions). Boots into a screen with some strange lines and colours and stays like that. But it was high time I bought a new one, the LG was really at the end of its life. Looking back, I'm glad I did it, lol.
