This lets a group of people (usually a family, but it could be close friends, too) share content between their Apple IDs . This is how you add someone to your Apple Music plan. So, the first thing you need to do is set up Family Sharing and then invite people to your family group. (If you use Apple Music on Android, check out the instructions in the next section on setting up Family Sharing.) Once that's done, you need to sign up for Apple Music . This is pretty easy, but there are a number of different scenarios here: If you haven't signed up for Apple Music before, choose a Family Plan during set up. Once you do that, each member of your Family Sharing family will have Apple Music available to them. If the people you want to share your Family Plan with are already Apple Music subscribers, they have to end their individual subscriptions (they'll lose the music they've added to their libraries and will need to add it again after joining your Family Plan). Then set up Family Sharing and sign up for an Apple Music Family Plan. If you have an individual Apple Music subscription, you'll have to change it to a Family Plan. Move on to the next step for instructions on how to do that. If you need to change an individual Apple Music subscription to a Family Plan, open the Music app on your iOS device (for instructions on doing this on a Mac or PC, check out these instructions from Apple ) and tap For You . Tap your profile (the icon of a head in a circle in the top corner). Tap View Account . Tap View Apple ID and enter your Apple ID password if you're prompted to do so. Tap Subscriptions (if you have other subscriptions through your Apple ID, tap Apple Music ). Tap Family and then confirm that choice to save it.
