Piseth Mao August 13, 2012 at 11:57 am Thanks everyone for trying to answer my question. You all are very kind even though the answer is not yet a solution to my problem. Anyway, while waiting for your solution, I came across an app that just does what I've expected. It is an app called \"Wifi File Transfer\" which allows us to manage our files and folders via Wifi. However, as the name tells, it needs wifi to make it possible. It is not as fast as the offline file manager but it is not very slow. I noticed it uploads the file at a speed of 1MB/s or more. What is cool about this app is that after uploading an app file to the SD card, you can just install it right away and just confirm it on your device. I love this app. It's even much better than Kies of Samsung which only allows us to do some basic things. Anyone interested, there is also a free version here on the play store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smarterdroid.wififiletransfer&feature=more_from_developer . Burhan Ahmed August 13, 2012 at 12:56 am http://www.android.com/filetransfer/ Download and install it. It will launch automatically. You must unlock your device to use it. it will show all the folders on your device Piseth Mao August 13, 2012 at 2:52 am I already installed it before coming to this forum, but I wouldn't get connected when I plugged in the tab. Any other solutions? MK September 19, 2012 at 2:59 pm Use filetransfer: http://www.android.com/filetransfer/ On the Galaxy Tab with the USB plugged into the Mac, tap the settings (bottom right) and for USB Connect as Camera (PTP) This has worked for me on both my MBP and MBA running OS X 10.5.8 and 10.7 Piseth Mao September 20, 2012 at 5:33 am I don't find this option on my tab (tab 10.1) running android 3.2 susendeep dutta September 28, 2012 at 2:47 pm Upgrade your tab to Android ICS or Jellbean if available and then you might be able to see this. Kannon Y August 12, 2012 at 8:49 pm There are special tools that were developed to allow Mac users Android device access. I believe it's a matter of file system compatibility. Unfortunately, Apple doesn't include these drivers by default, obviously because they want to discourage iPhone alternatives. You can find that software here . By the way, are you aware that Samsung recently pushed out Ice Cream Sandwich for the Tab ?
