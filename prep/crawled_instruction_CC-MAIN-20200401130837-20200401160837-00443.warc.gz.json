But I am not able to find accleaner... says its not there in the market anymore. Any other alternative suggestions? Reply Angela Alcorn April 13, 2011 at 1:07 pm Accleaner seems to have changed names very recently. Here's the link to the new version: https://market.android.com/details?id=com.a0soft.gphone.acc.free Reply Tim Parkinson March 28, 2011 at 5:09 am Its worth noting that while moving apps to the SD card is good for saving space, often you will find that widgets no longer work once the app has been moved. Apps with widgets often won't work unless the app is installed into the phone memory. Reply Angela Alcorn March 28, 2011 at 5:40 am This is true. But when you're dealing with as little room as I have, sacrifices have to be made. :) Reply Neo506 March 27, 2011 at 1:33 pm Thanks a lot! Reply Neo506 March 27, 2011 at 5:52 am You mentioned sleep app that \"allow certain people s calls to get through\" but I cannot seem to find any like that. can anyone please help? Reply Angela Alcorn March 27, 2011 at 7:27 am There are several options, but they're all paid which is why I didn't mention them by name. You can do a free trial for some of them, though.

I'd love to keep the home screen locked in memory so it doesn't have to reload from scratch so often. Reply Angela Alcorn March 26, 2011 at 4:02 pm Wow. I don't have lengthy delays like that. How annoying! Reply Bigtex ATX March 26, 2011 at 3:34 am The 'confirm call' thing, isn't that similar to Windows Vista/7 UAC that everyone hates? Amusing. Reply dvdhldn March 25, 2011 at 9:33 pm @CV - totally agree. I'm on the verge on no longer visiting! What we're they thinking! Reply Angela Alcorn March 26, 2011 at 5:33 pm It's going to be removed shortly - Thanks for the feedback! Reply GeekLad March 25, 2011 at 8:27 pm Having Google Voice prompt you if you want to use it each time you dial is a good alternative to Call Confirm, for avoiding accidental dials. I enable it, because on Sprint, mobile-to-mobile calls are free (any mobile, not just Sprint), so I use Google Voice to call land lines. Reply Bigtex ATX March 26, 2011 at 3:33 am I believe the new Sprint Google Voice merger deal remedies this. All calls in US are done via Sprints network (to use the mobile to mobile) and international calls GV. Might be worth a few questions to a Sprint rep in the know (not all will be). Reply Angela Alcorn March 26, 2011 at 4:02 pm People outside the US can't use Google Voice yet, but that does sound like a good plan for those who can. :) Reply Skoal March 25, 2011 at 8:22 pm Wow. That thing is annoying. Who would think that was a good idea? Reply CV March 25, 2011 at 8:01 pm This scrolling 'like' sidebar is the most annoying thing in my life. Most people click the page to focus right there so they can scroll. Please remove it. I'm closer to blocking this site every day. Reply Angela Alcorn March 26, 2011 at 4:00 pm Sorry, the theme is new and Aibek and co. are still ironing out the bumps. I'll pass on the feedback, for sure. Reply James Bruce March 26, 2011 at 5:10 pm We hear you loud and clear CV. We plan to remove it tomorrow, please hold on until then, I promise it will be gone and replaced with something altogether less annoying! Reply Anonymous March 28, 2011 at 3:36 am Hey, thanks for listening about the sidebar. It WAS annoying, and I like the bottom \"taskbar\" better, especially since we can hide it if we want to.
