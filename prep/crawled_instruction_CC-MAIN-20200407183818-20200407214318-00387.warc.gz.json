On Android Nougat you'll find this under Settings , tap Security , and enable Unknown Sources . On Android Oreo, you'll find this under Settings , tap Apps and Notifications , and select Install Unknown Apps . Download the APK file from the website where you've found the app. One popular website for finding apps off the Google Play store is APK Mirror . Save the file somewhere on your computer where you'll remember. Finally, with your phone connected to your computer, launch Minimal ABD and Fastboot. In the command prompt, type the command adb install <NameOfApp>.apk . Replace <NameOfApp> with the path and name of the APK file. In the example above, the APK file is stored in c:\\temp and the file is protonmail.apk. This command automatically transfers the APK file onto the Android device, and then runs the installer. Once the installer is done, you'll see the app show up in the list of apps installed on your phone. You can also uninstall apps using the adb uninstall command. But before you can do this, you need to know the full package name of the app that's installed on your phone. Review all packages installed on your phone by typing adb shell pm list packages . Search through this list to find the name of the app you want to install. Uninstall the app by typing adb uninstall <full package name>. Replace <full package name> with the full name of the app package you found in the list. After running the command, you'll see the word \"success.\" The app will disappear from the app list on your Android phone.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/use-minimal-adb-and-fastboot-4582201", "index": 1}
