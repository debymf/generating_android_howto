Depending on which Android you have, you may only use some of the screen or the video may get a little blocky depending on the quality of the stream and speed of your device.

Justin Ellenwood February 20, 2013 at 7:10 am If an Iphone, just close it like all your other apps Nevzat Akkaya February 14, 2013 at 6:32 am No, you can't. You can try Facebook app alternatives, maybe one of them does not have a consistent service. Shaun Sanders February 13, 2013 at 4:24 pm log out DrSunil Vaswani February 8, 2013 at 5:09 am hullo Does the app run in background because of Gps use? So if one can avoid app from accessing gps it would not run in background Pl comment what would be result of avoiding gps access and how to Nevzat Akkaya February 13, 2013 at 12:08 pm I don't think it's related to GPS access. It's irrelevant. Some programs have Android services so that they remain connected to their web services and receive notifications. I too have a phone with a very limited RAM, so I stopped using Facebook application, I'm using it's mobile interface via browsers like Dolphin, Maxthon... This way, when you exit from browser, no any RAM eater process or service is left. Nevzat Akkaya February 13, 2013 at 12:10 pm Correction : Android services are not just for connecting to web services. There are many usage scenarios for them :) DrSunil Vaswani February 13, 2013 at 3:47 pm Is there a way to avoid fb app from occuping memory after exiting the app Nevzat Akkaya February 13, 2013 at 3:55 pm Sorry but there is no easy way to do it. I have only one solution for it : freeze the Facebook app via Titanium Backup. Only this way bot the process and services can be shut down. The drawback is, everytime you want to start Facebook, you must unfreeze the app, use it, and freeze again. It's time consuming. Just use the browser interface like I do. That's the only simple solution. DrSunil Vaswani February 13, 2013 at 6:53 pm App would be preferable for notifications But it is noticed to automatically re-starts within few minutes after stopping it from running in background even if there are no notifications Can it be prevented from restarting without notifications? Peter Klepec February 6, 2013 at 6:57 pm If you have android: Settings > Applications > Running services > Click Faceboook > Click Stop until it's realy stopped. I hope this helped.

Ashwin Ramesh February 6, 2013 at 3:08 am There are certain apps like RAM Booster and Advanced Task Killer Pro to kill apps. You could check them out. DalSan Mack February 7, 2013 at 12:14 am I have used several task killers including what you suggested to no avail. Friendcaster allows you to kill the task and it won't restart as often or as quickly as the Facebook app. It would be nice to have the option to disable refreshing and updating in the settings, but I doubt that will happen any time soon. DrSunil Vaswani February 8, 2013 at 5:12 am hullo Does the app run in background because of Gps use So if one can avoid app from accessing gps it would not run in background DalSan Mack February 6, 2013 at 2:41 am Hello DrSunil, As long as you have the Facebook app installed and are using it from time to time, there is no real way to stop it from running. If you don't use it, I would uninstall it. If it cannot be uninstalled, you would need to have your phone rooted so you can use a program like Titanium Backup to \"freeze\" the app or uninstall it. The Facebook app constantly starts up in the background to try to connect with the Facebook servers so you can receive News Feed updates and such. No matter which task killer you use, it will not help in keeping the app killed. An alternative to the Facebook app would be Friendcaster for android, which I use. It offers pretty much everything you would want in a Facebook app, but you can also kill the app in the background and it won't restart as often.

So if one can avoid app from accessing gps it would not run in background DalSan Mack February 8, 2013 at 5:37 am It isn't so much that it keeps connecting to the GPS for location as it is trying to keep you informed of any status updates, new comments, likes, and requests. It would be nice to turn off these features as we would like and have it more like going through the web browser and only connect when we actually use it. Sunil February 8, 2013 at 8:41 am I understand I used to use an app named Scope for fb It also notified of status, messages , friend requests. But it did not automatically run in background Devon Truscott February 9, 2013 at 10:50 pm It's probably because that app was set up for push notifications from a facebook plugin. Another reason why facebook runs in the background is because it ties itself to your contact list. If anyone changes their contact info, it updates it in your contacts. It can't get pushed this information so it has to check on its own.", "url": "https://www.makeuseof.com/answers/how-can-i-keep-facebooks-mobile-app-from-automatically-running-in-the-background/", "index": 0}
