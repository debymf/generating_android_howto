Reply Greg November 20, 2019 at 1:34 pm Another useless article. If nothing is saved, then how come I can mention any type of activity or celebrity, and days later I'm getting flooded with ads about what was talked about over dinner while my phone was in my pocket? Reply Subaiyal August 23, 2019 at 6:29 pm Foolish person says recording everything will result in enormous amount of useless data. Well, Google can easily convert voice to text and an hour long speech will not take more than 200kb of data just in plain text. Google does record your voice in text form but as far as I think they use the data for advertisment purposes. Reply James Cook July 9, 2019 at 5:07 pm You think that changing the permissions is going to help? Google arent constrained by their own permissions api. Its nuts to think they are. They wrote the api that develpoers use but they have access at all levels because they wrote a lot of the code for android. Infact, a lot is not available to the public to access. Funnily enough, those bits are always where id put my hooks as a programmer to get what i need. They have root access to devices, and the filesystem. Ive looked deeply into a lot of google code and processes and so many dont make sense unless they are for what they apparently dont do. As a programmer reading their terms i see what is important to them and how they structure their data. They are fooling the uk government which isnt hard with a system of data collection that makes no sense as to the purpose they provide. The uk information commissioner doesnt understand his own job well enough to be able to understand what i put to them. Reply James Cook July 9, 2019 at 4:46 pm Christ, read their terms. Their tireless omissions speak volumes about how they collect data and why the facade of privacy doesnt bother them but covers them from further inspection. They have strange processes that make no sense except to gather information. They dont want information thats less specific than other forms. They survive off data as their business. They dont give you the option not to share. Theres not the space here, but they collect data on you many times over in overlapping ways. Theres no escape. You could buy a non smartphone and quit any internet use and still be in trouble. Make sure it has no bluetooth, internet, wifi, and btw, dont call any people with smartphones, oh, and you think then youre fine? Theres more.....oh, and dont use chrome or google search on your smartphone and you think youll be fine? The first 2 alternatives i tried were problematic. Yahoo and firefox, both caused connections to google. Urgghhh... and this is the very very start......it goes so much deeper....... i sound nuts, but i just cant be bothered to justify each statement with my findings.......i will if anyone wants to do an article. Reply Paul Schrum May 27, 2019 at 12:28 am I disabled Google Assistant about a week ago. I am still get ads for topics I have only talked about in face-to-face conversations. I decided to do the most radical thing and deny Google App permissions to the Microphone. (I hope that really even works.) Dear Google, this recording everything all the time breaks your oath of \"do no evil.\" Please stop doing it. Reply Jim cook July 9, 2019 at 4:41 pm They scrapped that oath recently btw. Probably because its existence caused ppl to ask why they created it in the first place and it seems more sinister to have it Reply zylstra April 6, 2019 at 12:56 am \"but it is not recording everything you say and uploading it to Google\" - Google doesn't need to do this. Google only needs to have a list of (ten of thousands of) keywords stored locally then upload only those that it thinks are relevant. Reply name September 16, 2018 at 6:00 pm \"does not record until it hears hot word/phrase\"... which means it is constantly listening and sending words off to google cloud computing to be analyzed to see if it IS the keyphrase ... Reply James Bruce September 17, 2018 at 11:46 am No, that's why a specific wake word needs to be used: for local analysis on the device. Reply Sandy July 28, 2018 at 4:43 pm I have Voice & Audio Activity paused and I still get a message saying \"saving audio to gmail account\" everytime I press the microphone. So it doesn't appear that I can stop Google from saving my speech when I use the microphone. The only way I can keep Google from saving audio is not to use the microphone at all. Very dissappointing. Reply Heidi July 23, 2018 at 9:22 am Thank you so much for this! This morning I wanted to take a screenshot for the very first time and wondered out loud how to do it. Then I only typed 'how to make a' into Google search and it came up with '.... screenshot on a samsung' as first choice. Then I get an email saying my service has been 'upgraded' to Google Assistant'. Coincidence? I think not. The Google support pages were useless in finding out how to restrict this insidious software; it may have taken me an hour to work through it all but your simple instructions have helped me so much - I am not a Luddite but decry the underhand tracking and algorithms following my mobile use (and really I just want a phone!) Remember, just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you! Reply Lolicon June 10, 2018 at 11:10 am Google is always listening, i was talking to someone about some led lights for car and guess what ads i got on chrome... car led lights. Reply Eep June 6, 2018 at 7:32 am No \"OK Google\" option in Android 7 on Moto G4. Reply Stewart Daniels March 18, 2018 at 7:34 am I went a step better. I removed Google Now from my device(s). Never been a fan of data grabbing/ tracking/ geolocating/ learning my face/ fingerprint, or voice for my 'Conveinience'. To me, it's invasive and creepy. Reply Xane Myers March 4, 2018 at 11:49 pm There's something else that can be done during the last step: Go into Google Assistant's settings, \"phone\", then there's an option named \"preferred input\", which can be set to keyboard. This does the same thing as tapping the keyboard icon when Assistant appears, but you don't have to quickly tap that button every time. Reply Renlikedindin February 27, 2018 at 5:58 am Well this was very informative ? And I thought I was tech savvy ? ha! Nope We as humans will learn new good stuff till we die. I guess we being watched also through our ? ? we do permission to do so. I guess placing black tape on camera lens can stop it. Reply Trinity February 23, 2018 at 7:37 am do you have a comparable article for iPhones? thanks! Reply Ben Stegner February 23, 2018 at 3:27 pm We don't have an article specifically addressing this for iPhone, but we do have an article on smartphones in general listening: //www.makeuseof.com/tag/your-smartphone-listening-or-coincidence/ We may be able to write an article like this about iPhone if there's enough material. Thanks for the suggestion! Reply Lori February 21, 2018 at 4:47 am So I don't have \"voice and audio\" listed under the options for filters. What does that mean? Reply IRS iTunes Card February 16, 2018 at 3:22 am STOP THE DAMN ANTI-BLOCKING MESSAGES ! YOU WILL GET BLOCKED ON CHROME 65 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Reply dragonmouth February 16, 2018 at 12:40 am \"Google explains that it uses your voice activity to help you get better results across its products\" Sounds like one of the Three Big Lies: We're from Google, we're here to help you.
