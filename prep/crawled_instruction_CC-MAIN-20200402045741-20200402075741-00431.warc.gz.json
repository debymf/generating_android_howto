Tap Custom, enter a name for the scene (such as Dinner Party or Watching TV ), then tap Add Accessories. Select the accessories you want this scene to include, then tap Done. The first accessory you select determines the room the scene is assigned to. If you first select your bedroom lamp, for example, the scene is assigned to your bedroom. Set each accessory to the state you want it in when you run the scene. For example, for a Reading scene, you could set the bedroom lights to 100 percent, choose a low volume for the HomePod, and set the thermostat to 68 degrees.", "url": "https://support.apple.com/en-lamr/guide/iphone/iphb96e3f655/ios", "index": 0}
