Image titled Find a Mate in the Sims 2 Step 2 2 Create a new Sim, or choose a 'blank' Sim from the Sim Bin. Image titled Have a Massive Party on the Sims 2 Step 6 3 Greet any or all the visitors that comes by. Use your imagination and flirt with the ones that you prefer or like. For example, the maid, gardener, or the pizza delivery guy. Image titled Find a Mate in the Sims 2 Step 12 4 Do not use force and choose for your character. Let your character build up some passion and preference for another character. If you believe and think that your character has found someone, start flirting. Image titled Get Married in Sims 2 Step 5 5 Do activities with the second character. Create a pool and have them swim in it, cook a meal together, get a couch and have them chat on it. However, you should avoid force and speed since either of their moods may diminish and disappear. Image titled Get Married in Sims 2 Step 6 6 Get the love moods to a high level. Start kissing and appreciate each other. Serenade, Sweet Talk, Romantic kiss, and Admire should do the trick. If the other Sim likes this attention, line up a whole list of actions. Something like: \"Chat, Chat, Sweet Talk, Joke, Chat, Kiss, Chat, Chat, Admire, Serenade\" . Image titled Get Married in Sims 2 Step 6Bullet1 If that works, and both are in a good mood, them go Propose >> Stay the Night. This will buy some extra time together! Image titled Get Married in Sims 2 Step 6Bullet2 Image titled Get Married in Sims 2 Step 7 7 Remove your current bed, and replace with a Double. Image titled Get Married in Sims 2 Step 8 8 Go to the bed >> Relax. Once your Sim has settled down, ask your mate to Join. When you are both on the bed, do Kiss/Make Out or Cuddle. Or just do both. Image titled Find a Mate in the Sims 2 Step 25 9 Do \"Try For Baby\" or simply \"WooHoo\". There may be a little video that runs automatically. If you selected \"Try For Baby\", and then heard a line of Lullaby at the end, your girl Sim is pregnant! (I'm sure some of you new \"simmers\" are wondering what WooHoo means. Sims is a teen rated game, not adult. Therefore, they can't say 'sex' in the game. That's what \"Woohooing\" is. Note: Teens can not Woohoo...only adults.) Image titled Get Married in Sims 2 Step 10 10 Wait for the option of \"Propose\" >> \"Engagement\" for you! ! Click on that, and the video will show them proposing. Image titled Get Married in Sims 2 Step 11 11 Click on the phone, and throw a wedding party! As soon as you phone up the guests, get that Altar thing, a party bar, and a wedding cake! Perhaps even a bottle of wine for a toast! Image titled Get Married in Sims 2 Step 12 12 Let the wedding begin! Image titled Get Married in Sims 2 Step 13 13 Click the altar, and Get Married!
