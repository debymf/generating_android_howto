There are other apps like Documents that can download files but we've found that this one works the best, especially if you want to be able to lock your phone and still listen to music (you can't do that with the iOS YouTube app). Open Documents and tap the small browser icon on the bottom corner. Open GenYouTube (or any other online YouTube video downloader) and find the video you want to download as an MP3. You can also paste the link to the video if you already copied a direct link from an email, a text message, the YouTube app, your web browser, etc. From the video's download page, scroll down a bit and select the MP3 option. When asked, enter a name for the MP3 and then choose a folder to save it in, or use the default one. Select Save to download the MP3 to your iPhone. You can play the MP3 file from whatever folder you chose in Step 5. Use the button on the bottom left-hand corner of the Documents app to return to your folders and open the MP3.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/youtube-to-mp3-4157773", "index": 0}

You can pause it for now. With the video page open, launch the developer tools menu . Windows (Chrome): At the top-right corner of Chrome, open the three-dotted menu button and find More tools > Developer tools . The keyboard shortcut is Ctrl+Shift+I (uppercase \"i\"). Windows (Firefox): Open the Firefox menu at the top-right corner and choose Web Developer > Inspector ( Ctrl+Shift+C works, too). Mac (Chrome): Use the three-dotted menu at the top-right corner to find More Tools > Developer Tools , or hit the Command+Option+I (uppercase \"i\") hotkey. Mac (Firefox): From the menu button in the upper-right corner of the screen, navigate to Web Developer > Inspector , or open it with your keyboard via Command+Option+C . Change the user agent of your web browser so that you can trick YouTube into thinking that you're accessing the video from a mobile browser. This is the only way to make sure the video is actually downloadable. Chrome: From the very top-right corner of developer tools, right next to the x button, is another dotted menu button. Use that to open More tools > Network conditions . Uncheck Select automatically , and choose Firefox - iPhone . Firefox: From a new tab, in the address bar, enter about:config and confirm the \"risk\" message (if you see it). In the search box that appears, search for general.useragent.override . If it's missing (it probably is), choose String and then select the plus sign off to the right. Give it this value: Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 8_3 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/600.1.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) FxiOS/1.0 Mobile/12F69 Safari/600.1.4 Return to the YouTube page if you're not already there, and refresh it, but keep the developer tools menu open. The page should change a bit and the video will fill nearly the whole screen. If Firefox or Chrome automatically redirects you back to the desktop page, select the link that says to return to the mobile version of YouTube. Start the video, again, keeping the developer tools window open. Pause it after it's been playing for a few seconds. From the developer tools window, locate the small mouse pointer icon it lets you choose which element to inspect on the page. It should be at the very top-left corner of the window. With that tool enabled, select the video. Back in the developer tools window, look for a section that includes a really long URL. It begins with the text src=\"https:// and is probably blue, and may even be highlighted already. After some random characters should be what reads .googlevideo.com/videoplayback . Don't see this link? Open the Network tab of the developer tools menu and select the videoplayback entry to find the link off to the right in the Headers section. Double-click, double-tap, or manually select the URL to highlight it, and then copy the link by right-clicking or tapping-and-holding the text and picking the copy option. You can also use your keyboard: Ctrl+C in Windows or Command+C in macOS. Open a new tab in Chrome or Firefox and paste that URL into the address bar, and then press Enter to open it. The whole page should look different than YouTube's normal website but the video should start playing normally. Depending on how it was copied, there might be some unnecessary text at the beginning and end and the video that prevents it from opening. If the page doesn't load, erase src=\" from the beginning and \" from the end so that the URL starts with https:// and ends with a letter or number (not a quotation mark). Right right-click or tap-and-hold the video, choose the save option, and pick somewhere on your computer to save it to. There may even be a download button on the bottom corner of the video that you can select instead.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/youtube-to-mp3-4157773", "index": 1}
