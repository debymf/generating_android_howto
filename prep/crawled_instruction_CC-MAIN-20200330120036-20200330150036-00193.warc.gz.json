If your account is enabled for two-factor authentication, you'll now be prompted to enter a six-digit verification code that should have been sent to your iPad or iPhone. Type that code into the fields provided. You might now be asked whether or not you trust the browser that you're using. If you're on a public device or a shared computer, we recommend selecting the Don't Trust button. If you're on your own personal device and do not want to be asked to enter a verification code each time you log into iCloud, click on Trust . If you aren't sure what to do at this time, just choose the Not Now button instead. A dashboard of icons will now be displayed, not unlike those found on your iOS Home Screen. Select the Mail icon to send and receive iCloud email, or the Calendar icon to access your appointments and reminders.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/check-icloud-email-from-anywhere-4587119", "index": 0}
