It asks you to enter your desired Google username and password, gender, birthday, country location, current email address, and mobile phone number. It won't ask for your street address or credit card information, though, and the truth is, you don't have to fork over your cellphone number or email address. While it asks for your current email and mobile phone, you can leave both fields blank and proceed. Google won't stop you from registering if you don't provide that information. Finally, it may ask you to type a few squiggly letters to prove you're not a robot. The biggest challenge on this form is finding a Google username that isn't already taken. It will suggest adding numbers to popular phrases you may enter that are already in use, so keep trying until you find an available username that you like. Click Next to submit the information and go to the next step.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/youtube-account-signup-2655499", "index": 0}
