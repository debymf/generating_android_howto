As when using an Android smartphone, you start by downloading the Wear OS app, if you haven't already. The watch must be charging during the pairing process; this is not the case when pairing with an Android. In the app, you should see a list of nearby devices, including your smartwatch. Tap that, and the pairing process will start. Both your iPhone and the watch will display a pairing code; make sure they match and then tap pair. Finally, on your iPhone, you'll be prompted to turn on a handful of settings, and that's it.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/pairing-android-wearables-with-the-iphone-3875746", "index": 0}
