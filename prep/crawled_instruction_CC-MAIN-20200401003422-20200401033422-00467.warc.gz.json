I'm still a bit sad about it and haven't decided on a new default note app yet. Reply Got Your Number August 5, 2013 at 5:22 am If a simple 'note-taking' app (after all we're talking about scribblings here, not rocket engine design), such as Evernote, is a 'steep learning curve', then it's already failed as a simple note-taking app. I note that others use 2 or more apps for 'note-taking'. Again, utterly daft. We've become tourists in our own lives, living life staring at screens, shuffling information around on them. I utterly reject that life. If that's your thing, enjoy. But one thing I know. On your deathbed, you're not going to be reflecting on how you never found the perfect note-taking app during you brief life. Reply Theo Benschop March 7, 2017 at 7:01 pm @Got Your Number, It's in the history of mankind indeed a simple thing: in former times people had to hunt distraction-free for animals or to work very hard in the fields in order to have something to eat. In the here and now of the days of the digital internet however many people in western high wages countries have in the offices as a sort of slave of the banks indeed become tourists in their own lifes, living indeed a life that is structured by the far from distracrion-free moments that he or she is staring at screens, indeed shuffling information about the history of mankind that everybody already knows around them. So the only way in utterly rejecting that life will be plan B in a one way distraction-free ticket to paradise, where one can't see one single office where the people are far from disstraction-free staring at their screens, what they apperantly as a sort slave of the bank enjoy. So only God knows when one is on his or her deathbed whether he or she will remember the things that he or she made far from distraction-free a note of in order to be able to reflect on for instance how he or she never found the perfect note-taking app during his or hers brief lifes. Reply Haider May 8, 2013 at 6:56 pm Evernote is highly overrated . It has sync issues and problem of one single database file which acts weird when it grows big and old . It issues are mentioned on the forums Reply George April 16, 2017 at 9:46 pm I've been using Evernote for years and am extremely disappointed, not with the sync issues, but with the pricing and usage policy. I tried migrating to OneNote which shortly developed a corrupt database and sync issues Reply Shiraz Mistry April 12, 2013 at 4:46 am Thanks for the comparison. Will you be doing a new one with the addition of Google Keep? Reply Muhammad H April 11, 2013 at 2:29 am I really thing the comparison is between Evernote and onenote and shortly it will be google keep.... Reply Mr. herb March 23, 2013 at 8:55 pm Article well done, Catch was my first and I still enjoy that , but I enjoy even more the Evernote and haven't put it down, because of the Syncing with the PC and Android, the apps that come with Evernote are great. Reply DonB March 21, 2013 at 4:49 am And now comes Google Keep. It's in the beginning stages, but it's been launched. Give it a try: http://drive.google.com/keep It's simple and will sync across devices. No sharing or collaboration, yet. Reply Emma March 5, 2013 at 11:33 pm I've only used Springpad, but I really love it's flexibility. I have both my Youtube favorites and Pinterest repins going over there via IFTTT to have one collected hub of things I like. It also has my collection of interesting tech articles and app tips, some recipes, movies and games I want to check out etc. If only I'd have an easy way to sync it with Goodreads and Hypejar as well to make it even more of a centralized hub for my interests. And if I want to, I can just make a simple checklist as well without the extra fuzz. I used to use Out of Milk, but after I realized I could do the same stuff with another app I was already using, I switched over to Springpad (partly because of limited memory on my HTC Desire, but also because it really was convenient enough). In short, I'm quite annoyed with all the interesting stuff in the web sprawling over different accounts, so I'm glad I can unify the experience at least somewhat. With well organized boards it's well easy enough to find what I'm looking for when needed. Reply joellee March 9, 2013 at 7:50 am After what you said, I think I'm starting to see the appeal of Springpad. Unification is always a great feature of convenience and that's one of the reasons why people love Google products. Being able to centralize with Springpad may be enough to get me to try it out again, with purpose this time! Reply Julian Altshul March 5, 2013 at 11:44 am I've never tried Catch, but I have tried the other 3 of these apps and Evernote gets my vote. One Note and Springpad are both decent but I find Evernote the easiest to use - syncing is straightforward, and the search function works well and is quick - if you have lots of notes and need to find something in a hurry. I tend to store mainly text notes and web clippings, with the odd audio note. Springpad might suit you better if you like to store more visual material. @Joel Lee and @Kelly Buchanan, I can see a lot of sense in using more than one of these apps for different purposes and I agree, Springpad looks more like a scrapbook. Reply joellee March 9, 2013 at 7:48 am Straightforwardness is a great quality and I can see why so many people, including yourself, prefer Evernote over the rest. If you ever get a chance, do try Catch though. You may be pleasantly surprised. :) Reply Julian Altshul March 9, 2013 at 11:55 am Thanks Joellee, I'll check it out! Reply EdmarJohn SanDiego March 3, 2013 at 10:59 pm i think ill try catch note because it has a nice GUI and its featured in vsauce Reply Greg March 3, 2013 at 5:15 pm I'm cheap! So, in articles like this, I'd like to see a summary of the limits to the free version vs paid. And limits that force you to upgrade to a paid version such as, in this case, a limit on the total number of free notes (if it's a number I'd reach in a month or two), is a show stopper. Thanks for the article--right length for a quick understanding of these products. Reply mete March 2, 2013 at 4:13 am There is one more criteria that you missed and it's Sharing. I added my friends accounts to my springpad and give permissions to view, edit my notebooks. We are taking notes, sharing usefull links together. Reply Jo o Laranjeira March 1, 2013 at 2:00 pm I thimk evernote the best, but i have to try the others to see better if is true. Reply mike March 1, 2013 at 1:40 pm I don't understand why Evernote allows a very easy import of OneNote but OneNote has no import from Evernote capability. I use both apps but my permanent base of notes is OneNote. The problem I have is if I create anything in Evernote I can only copy / paste to OneNote which is fine for a note or two but not 20-30 or more. There was an app that converted Evernote to OneNote imports but it hasn't been updated to Windows 8. Hopefully that app will get an update. Reply Tarek Ramadan March 1, 2013 at 12:10 pm I use ever note in my laptop and my android mobile but the mobile version is not as good as springbad Reply Dhruv Sangvikar March 1, 2013 at 11:53 am Each of the tool is good if you need it for indivisual purposes. But for sharing based usage ..atleast for me, Catch is better than Evernote. Reply Joel Lee March 1, 2013 at 7:18 pm I agree. I do prefer Catch to Evernote in almost every way. :D Reply Nikhil Chandak March 1, 2013 at 10:00 am For me , NoteEveryThing (android app) is better than evernote !! Give it a try , guys ! Reply Joel Lee March 1, 2013 at 7:17 pm Never heard of it but I'll look into it. Thanks! Reply Nikhil Chandak March 2, 2013 at 7:20 am @Joel Lee , I use it everyday to write notes or for something else , but its great !! for me ..... Reply Nevzat Akkaya March 1, 2013 at 7:05 am The comparative article I need, many thanks. Reply Junil Maharjan March 1, 2013 at 6:16 am I have been evernote and it is a great app. this is one of my favourite apps on android. Reply Kelly Buchanan March 1, 2013 at 5:27 am I use Springpad for curating personal collections like wine lists, book lists, restaurant reviews, gift ideas, etc.. I use Evernote for more practical, utilitarian uses like collaborating on work projects, expense receipts (with Expensify), meeting notes, and lists. Catch could work for me like Evernote but Evernote's functionality suits my work style better. I like having them seperate. They both work well for me. Reply Joel Lee March 1, 2013 at 7:17 pm Springpad does feel more like a scrapbook, which is great for clipping and saving things for later (like you're doing). But I guess I have no use for that which is why I feel it's just overly complex. Good that it works for you, though. Reply Augusto March 1, 2013 at 3:16 am Some important notes about some of those tools (I tried all of them too). Evernote doesn't do offline caching in the free version of the service. Killer issue for me. Catch has a limit on the number of streams (5) in the free version. But it's the most simple to take quick notes too. Springpad, as you said, is a bit too complex. As it has multiple types of data it requires you to chose that before adding the item every time. Unnecessary complexity IMO. I use catch for simple text notes and Springpad for other stuff, like clipping content from websites and wine wish lists. Reply Joel Lee March 1, 2013 at 7:16 pm Good catch on those limitations that I missed. I think it's smart to use different apps for different purposes like you (Springpad + Catch). Nice! Reply Hari March 18, 2013 at 4:13 am It is funny how most reviews miss the Evernote limitation. It is actually surprising that the service became so popular with this huge limitation. I had it was already popular on the desktop before the mobile revolution started. I started using SpringPad because it had no such limitations on the mobile, but their chrome extension is very limited, which is huge limitation for me. E.g., you can not edit notes and the direct link to open notes on the web app had been broken for very long, so it requires many click before you can start editing it. Lately I have been using GNotes for quick note taking and log maintenance (it supports buttons to enter date and time other than automatic bulleting). It syncs with Gmail, so the notes are available readonly outside the app. I wish there is a web app to edit notes from browser.
