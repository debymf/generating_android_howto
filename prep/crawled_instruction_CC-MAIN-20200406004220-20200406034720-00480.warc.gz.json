Did a search for Autolaunch...nothing found. I have version 8.0 on a Moto g6. Any ideas? Thank you. Reply isse August 21, 2018 at 5:13 pm I like many of these. \"The first is that this version of Android restricts access to mic, camera, and all SensorManager sensors from apps that are idle according to Google.\" <-- This should have been done a LONG time ago. Reply Erin August 14, 2018 at 2:56 pm I would love to force dark mode, but when I try to tap the \"about\" screen, it just takes me to the other screen, so I can't get the developer options. I am using a Pixel 2Xl on Android Pie. Maybe that's why it's not working? Any other suggestions to get it to work? Reply Kris Royall August 21, 2018 at 4:43 pm You tap About, and that takes you to the other screen. At the top of that screen there is an arrow pointing to the left, and the words to the right of that are 'About Android Auto'. Tap on just the words not the arrow to the left of it, about 10 times to get developer mode. Reply Erin August 21, 2018 at 4:48 pm Thanks, that worked! I just must have totally misread the instructions. I'll try it out later today. Reply", "url": "https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/android-auto-tweaks/", "index": 0}
