Reply amuro August 7, 2013 at 7:34 pm Apex Launcher pro in Tablet mode is the cleanest one ive had. Reply Steven G August 7, 2013 at 4:19 pm I am curious why this is not covering GO Launcher EX, that is an amazing one Reply T Steve August 8, 2013 at 10:41 am Taking Nothing away from a free launcher with near premium features, adding icons to the home screen is not as smooth as a normal user would find in other launchers of the same cadre. (Tap and hold from the app drawer) Also Long press App icon to choose to go to app info, has not been witnessed in GO Launcher EX Reply Steven G August 8, 2013 at 1:18 pm Near Premiums are to me better then paying anywhere from $7 - $15 for an application that does what is given to me free by the phone itself. I like to test different home screens because I am not one to stay consistent at times, yet I have found that I always go back to the Free Go Launcher EX and some of the additional Widgets that work with it. If companies are going to make a free launcher then offer a paid version, I expect the paid version to blow the free version out of the water by a LOT!!!

Thanks. Reply Barrie M August 7, 2013 at 6:52 am I would just like to recommend Action Launcher. It is more than just a new app draw. It also includes \"shutters\" on Jelly Bean devices which allow you to swipe and app icon and get the widget. [Broken Link Removed] Reply Joel Lee August 10, 2013 at 2:34 am It looks great but it's a shame there's no free version so people can try before buying. :( Reply Dan August 7, 2013 at 6:18 am I use Smart Launcher. Minimalist but very nice. I wish it had widget support for the free version. Reply Joel Lee August 10, 2013 at 2:33 am Thanks! I love minimalism and Smart Launcher looks superb. Going to look more into it! Reply Rajendra August 7, 2013 at 4:59 am MIhome launcher for iPhone style is also worthy ... Reply Nohl L August 7, 2013 at 4:00 am I am a little surprised that Buzz Launcher was not listed. It's pretty versatile; coordinates with a number of popular widgets; and it lets you share your best ideas with thousands of other people worldwide. Reply Joel Lee August 10, 2013 at 2:32 am Never heard of Buzz Launcher but it looks real nice. Thanks! Reply Paul in NJ August 7, 2013 at 3:04 am Presumably these work on Android tablets too... Reply Joel Lee August 10, 2013 at 2:31 am Most of them should, but I would double check on the app page before installing any of them! Reply Rajaa C August 7, 2013 at 1:08 am I use a Samsung Galxy Chat GT-B5330 and few months ago received the JB 4.1.2 official update. However, the whole experience was getting killed by the Samsung touchwiz interface. That is when I hecided that I would really appreciate the stock Android interface experience and switched to Holo Launcher HD free version, and till date never regretted my decision. It is fast and snappy and is a beautiful launcher. Reply Rick August 7, 2013 at 3:58 am I use Holo as well, albeit the pro version, with the standard Holo on my old Froyo phone and the HD on my newer Jellybean. I agree. Awesome launcher! Lightweight, fast and snappy, yet feature filled. Reply Vipul J August 7, 2013 at 5:49 am +1 to Holo Launcher HD. Basically it's pretty similar to Apex & Nova but because of one feature I stick to Holo. I can assign swipe up or down as a gesture to open recent apps which usually works by long pressing my Home key on my SGS2 I9100. So its kind of saving my button's life! Nova & Apex have gestures too but none have the option of assigning recent apps in it. Reply Anonymous Droider August 7, 2013 at 8:14 am As for Apex, tap Menu > Apex settings > Behavior Settings > Under Gestures, select whichever gesture you want, (for ex, in your case, swipe up/down) and assign Recent apps to it. Mostly Nova will have a way of doing the same as well. Reply Vipul J August 8, 2013 at 10:20 am Apex was the first launcher I tried on my S2 and it did have gestures but not recent apps to assign. Anonymous Droider August 8, 2013 at 10:34 am At the time of posting my comment, I manually set the swipe up gesture to \"Recent Apps\" in the way as mentioned in my comment. I was using the latest version, i.e. Apex Launcher Pro v2.0.6 At present I'm using Nova Launcher Prime v2.2 And the steps are as follows Menu > Nova Settings > Gestures and Buttons > Swipe Up / Swipe Down > Recent apps (The list of assignable actions is scrollable in both launchers) Vipul J August 8, 2013 at 10:52 am In that case, thanks I'll check them. I always tried the free ones and found it only in Holo HD free. I guess pro versions would have that feature. Anonymous Droider August 8, 2013 at 10:59 am Cheers. I'm sure Googling the name + version of the pro versions will point you to the right direction. Joel Lee August 10, 2013 at 2:30 am Holo is definitely a great one. Thanks for sharing!
