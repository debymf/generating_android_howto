This is a really good idea since you're about to wipe it clean. If you are SURE you have a recent backup, you can skip this step (though we don't recommend it). A confirmation window will make sure you want to restore your iPhone. Click Restore if you're ready, and wait for the iPhone to restart after several minutes.
