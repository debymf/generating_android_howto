On the left-side menu, scroll down and tap \" iCloud .\" In the iCloud settings, choose \" Photos .\" Tap the switch next to iCloud Photos to on/green. The Optimize iPad Storage option will download thumbnail versions of photos when the iPad is low on space. Selecting Download and Keep Originals will mean you'll always download full-size versions of images from iCloud. The \" Upload to My Photo Stream \" option will synchronize the full images across devices that have this option turned on (e.g., your iPhone or Mac). This setting is useful if you need access to the photos even when you don't have an Internet connection. Turn the Shared Albums switch to on/green to enable the ability to create sharable photo albums that you store on iCloud. These settings save automatically, so you can go to the Home screen when you're done.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/use-icloud-photo-library-1994619", "index": 0}
