Two ways are available for connect your phone with pc via this app. They are USB connection and Wi-Fi connection. Step 1 connect your phone with pc For USB connection, connect your phone with PC, open the USB debugging, then a management interface would be displayed. Photos are classified in the left list of the interface. Click photos and enter the album interface to pick the photo you wanted. Step 2 transfer your photos to PC Click \"export\" button, then your photos would be exported to your computer files. The third-part option is also a good choice.
