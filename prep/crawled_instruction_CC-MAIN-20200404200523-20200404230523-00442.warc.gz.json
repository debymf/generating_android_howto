Is there enough battery charge for it to power up? Is it unlocked? Make sure to 'Trust' your computer . If you connect your iPhone to your computer using your USB cable, look for a \" Trust this Computer?\" notification on your phone. If you see one, tap Trust . Otherwise, your iPhone won't connect to your PC or Mac, and you won't be able to transfer files to and from each device (among other things). There's also a possibility that, for whatever reason, you may have previously tapped \"Don't Trust,\" which would prevent your iPhone from connecting to your computer. In this case, you need to reset your iPhone's \"Location & Privacy\" settings, by doing the following: Launch Settings . Tap General . Tap Reset . Tap Reset Location & Privacy . Doing this will give you the chance to trust your computer all over again when connecting to it via a USB cable. Check the cable. Often, the failure of your iPhone to connect to your computer simply results from a faulty cable. As such, you should make sure you're using the cable supplied with your iPhone, or at least an official Apple cable you purchased separately. Check the USB port. Try plugging the iPhone into a different USB port. Similar to trying different USB cables, it might be worth trying to connect your iPhone to another of your computer's USB ports if it has more than one. Restart your iPhone and/or computer . This is another simple piece of advice, but it's amazing how often a simple restart can clear up issues. To begin with, restart your iPhone normally and see if that gets it connecting to your computer again. If not, try restarting your computer. Update iTunes . Generally, iPhone owners use iTunes to connect to their computers, regardless of whether they're running a Mac or a Windows PC. As such, it's always a good idea to ensure that you're on the latest version of iTunes since the problem could stem from some kind of bug the latest version fixes. Update your operating software . If you've done all of the above, including updating iTunes, your next port of call should be to trying to update your macOS or update your version of Windows (if an update is available). Update your Driver Software . This step applies only to Windows users, and it involves updating the software that handles how your computer connects with your iPhone.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-wont-connect-to-computer-fix-4584162", "index": 0}
