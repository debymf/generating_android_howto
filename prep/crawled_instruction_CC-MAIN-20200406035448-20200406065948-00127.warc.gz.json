In your container's rules, click New to add a new rule. A rule that blocks a tag from firing always overrides a firing rule. For example, if a tag has a firing rule \"all devices\" and a blocking rule \"Device Name equals Nexus One\", the tag will never fire on devices named \"Nexus One\". A tag will fire whenever any of its firing rules is met. For example, if a tag has two firing rules, one for \"all devices\" and another for \"Samsung Android\", the tag will fire on all devices. Once you've finished building your rule, click Save . In the Firing Rules section, click Add Rule to Fire Tag to select which tags to apply your rule to.", "url": "https://support.google.com/displayvideo/answer/6039525?hl=en-GB&ref_topic=6071843", "index": 0}
