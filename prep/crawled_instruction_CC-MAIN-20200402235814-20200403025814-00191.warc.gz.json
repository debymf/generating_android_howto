During your trip, swipe up from the bottom of the app and tap your selected payment method. Tap Split Fare . Enter the names or phone numbers of the riders you want to split the fare with. Each rider will get a notification asking them to accept the split. Once they accept, the fare will be equally divided among the group. If someone doesn't accept the request or they don't have a valid payment method, you'll be charged for both your portion of the fare and theirs. Uber charges each participating rider with a $0.25 fee to split a fare. Your receipt will show the total amounts charged to all riders.
