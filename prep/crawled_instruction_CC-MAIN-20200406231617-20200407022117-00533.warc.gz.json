Tap Local and Device to see your device's root folder. You can access the root folder, and navigate to misc and wifi to see the Wi-Fi security key in the wpa_supplicant.conf file. This option requires root access, so it won't work for most users. Another option is to install an Android terminal emulator and issue the cat /data/misc/wifi/wpa_supplicant.conf command to view the file contents and see the network security key. Again, root access is required. The best option without root is to install and connect Minimal ADB and Fastboot on your PC . Once you're connected to your Android, you can access and view the contents of the wpa_supplicant.conf file to see your stored Wi-Fi password.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/find-network-security-key-4589025", "index": 0}
