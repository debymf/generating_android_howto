I have Microsoft Photos on Windows 10 (on an Asus ZenBook) but I can't see all the functions you mentioned in this interesting article.

Used to be able to move photos around to where I wanted into different folders under different dates to when taken. I could add information to each photo to identify where taken and identity of person. Windows photo gallery was easy to use and could have just had changes made to enhance the program and a lot of people would have been happy . Now as previous comments made Windows 10 photos program not as expected and mixes photos up. No easy editing. Transferred my photos from older computer expecting to file in same order and keep the editing information on each picture and folder and instead ended up jumbled all up filed under different dates and no editing information to identify where photo taken or person in photo.

The thing I miss terribly is the ability to blur the backgrounds! Why would they leave that feature off the update? I find the new filters to be quite unappealing. I also miss a more distinct contrast! I found the wheel dials in the previous version to be extremely user-friendly and fast. Hoping I can go back to the previous version. Reply Becki Zeipen November 20, 2016 at 9:43 pm I was very unhappy with the automatic/unwanted update as well. I found a note on another site and the advise given was to go to your control panel, then system and security, then security and maintenance, then recovery, then open system restore. I restored to a date before the update took place, which was 11/13/16 on my computer. I now have the previous version and was able to edit photos as I had done on 11/12/16. Yeah!!!!! I then went to my Microsoft store settings and made sure the automatic update button was toggled off. Reply Missie T. December 1, 2016 at 7:12 pm Hi, Becki. I tried everything just as you listed. But to no avail. When I get to \"restore to date before\", I find that Windows has automatically set a date three days prior to the current date. I tried to manually override that, also to no avail. Windows will not let me. I tinkered around and thought I had conquered this, re-booted my computer, then went in to restore, found my \"restore\" date, thought \"Ahha! Maybe it worked!\". When I went into my photos, the same ridiculous photo-editing program is still in place. I cannot seem to get rid of it and go back to the original program. Currently, I am researching online options for other Photo-editing programs, but so far, I have not found any that are even close to the Windows programming I had just a couple weeks ago. Reply Joe November 20, 2016 at 1:37 am it would be great if file names were displayed and also if it were possible to select which files types (eg jpg but not raw) in a directory to display. Reply Debra Ruth Poliquin November 18, 2016 at 6:50 pm I too was shocked to open the app and find it completely replaced. I do find that many of the new features are good, but like other comments have noted, there are some great features of the old app missing. I miss the shadows button also. I DO find that the \"enhance\" feature in the new version works MUCH better than in the old. My BIGGEST COMPLAINT is that when using the \"spot fix\" feature, when you enlarge the photo to get at small defects, you cannot move around the photo. I take photos of small jewelry items. So most of my photos are very close-up and so even specks of dust will show up in the photos. When I enlarge the photo, I can't move around any longer. I used to be able to click the left mouse button and then move the mouse and go to any part of the enlarged picture and clean up dust and other defects. There is only one size button for \"spot-fix\" so it doesn't' work on my tiny items when it is normal sized. I hope that makes sense. Now I will have to find another editor to work with because of that ONE really important feature being gone. Otherwise, for me, most of the new app I can live with. If anyone knows of a way to move around the photo when it is enlarged and using \"spot-fix\" please let me know. Thanks! Reply Missie T. November 17, 2016 at 1:07 am Yesterday--11-15-16-- while photo-editing, everything as described above was in place on my Windows 10 photo app. And I have had it in place since we got Windows 10 in April, and have been using it successfully since--gradually getting more and more familiar with it. Today--11-16-16--when I went to edit photos, the entire photo editing program had changed. Completely changed. Does anyone know what happened???

Reply HikingMike November 16, 2016 at 8:37 pm How do you view actual size of the image in Windows 10 Photos viewer? It seems to enlarge images that are smaller than the window, which of course makes them blurry if they were sharp before. How is this not an option? Not every image is a photograph or larger than the screen size. Reply IMRAN November 14, 2016 at 6:45 am Aren't these things almost every Photos app on the planet offers since the last 10 years? Yet, in 2016 Microsoft's own boards have people begging for a way to select multiple images without having to click on every single one. e.g. choose 78 photos out of 178 in a series, and you cannot click and drag, at least according to MS' own (no)Help pages.

I am shocked...I love boosting the color. The only problem is I prefer doing the majority of my editing in other apps, so I usually bounce back and forth between Photos, Photoshop and various apps on my Note 5. It's a pain. Would love to know of another app that lets you selectively and easily boost the colors, as this app does. Meanwhile, good job Microsoft. I have never understood the hate of Windows 10. Reply Tom L. August 15, 2016 at 8:03 pm The photo editing in Windows 10 default Photos app has some nice tricks, but organizing photos by date alone is PATHETIC. In Windows Photo Gallery you have: a) naming and folder creation options at IMPORT which are quite powerful. NOTHING like this in PHOTOS. b) ability to assign comments, tags (like \"birds\" \"landscape\"), anything you like, AND renaming of files on the same window. NOT POSSIBLE in Photos. The good news / bad news for me -- I just bought a new DELL with Win 10 preinstalled, and with a little tweaking have my old Photo Gallery from the Win 7 machine working. Cool, that's the good. The bad -- the screen layout is reformatted, harder to read, AND I just tried to use the AUTO ADJUST button, and it's gone loco -- it whited out most of the image. Thank God the revert function still works. Reply Josef July 30, 2016 at 3:09 am I do not like the way Photos creates automatically Albums. They just pic a few pictures from folders. It doesn't make sense. I hope I can delete all automatically created albums. Having said that, I do like the albums, they look nice. I would like Photos to have the same functionality like OneDrive, where I can create Album from a folder by right clicking on it. I have 200 folders with 10,000 pictures, and creating albums picture by picture would take the rest of my life. Reply chris9465 July 29, 2016 at 12:35 pm How do you move photos out of the photo app? How do I see my photos on my hard drive? how do I mass delete all the dated folders I don't want need or asked for? how do we chose are own organization format? how do I stop the auto creation of dated files from my phone/camera to this app? These are the reasons photo app is an abomination. The answer to all of the above questions is: you can't.

Reply Apoettoo July 20, 2016 at 4:54 am It would be great if they would come out with a Windows 10 version of Photo Gallery. Photos does not do panoramas, which was a major wonderful thing about Photo Gallery. The Fine Tuning in Photo Gallery put all the editing features a click away. That made it easy to balance the light and color without opening and closing one feature or the other like in Photos. Why does Microsoft abandon good programs and come up with these sad replacements? Pity it is. Reply Joanne Khoury July 31, 2016 at 12:54 pm I miss the features in Photo Gallery that automatically saved a photo once I clicked on the next photo and allowed me to use all the filters (fine tuning) without having to click on each one. It's more time-consuming to have to click on Save for each photo and then select the filters each time. I also miss the Revert to Original feature and the Sharpness feature. When creating new programs, I do not understand why can't Microsoft create programs that keep all the features its users are used to and merely add new features.
