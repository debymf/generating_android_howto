Just look in the later posts how others have done it. ;-) historydoll December 29, 2010 at 3:44 am AFAIK, once the device and the Mac have been paired, it's automatic on startup. I have a Mac Mini and a Bluetooth keyboard, and it happens automatically, though it sometimes takes a minute to be able to use the keyboard to login.

Jonathan December 27, 2010 at 4:45 pm I'm not familiar with macs but on windows you can do this sort of thing using \"scheduled tasks\". Perhaps you will be able to find a mac equivalent. hope you can work it out", "url": "https://www.makeuseof.com/answers/mac-os-automatically-connect-bluetooth-device-startup/", "index": 0}
