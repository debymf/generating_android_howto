Decide which two you want to use. Lightly tap and hold one of the apps until all apps on the screen start shaking (this is the same process that you use to re-arrange apps ). Making folders on the iPhone 6S and 7 series, the iPhone 8, iPhone X, XS and XR, and iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max is a little trickier. That's because the 3D Touch screen on those models responds differently to different presses on the screen. If you have one of those phones, don't press too hard or you'll trigger a menu or shortcut. Just a light tap and hold is enough. Drag one of the apps on top the other. When the first app seems to merge into the second one, take your finger off the screen. Dropping one app into the other creates the folder. What happens next depends on what version of the iOS you're running. In iOS 7 and higher, the folder and its suggested name take up the entire screen. In iOS 4-6, you'll see the two apps and a name for the folder in a strip across the screen Every folder has a name assigned to it by default (more on this in a minute), but you can change that name. Tap the x icon to clear the suggested name and then type the name you want. If you want to add more apps to the folder, tap the wallpaper to close the folder. Then drag more apps into the new folder. When you've added all the apps you want and edited the name, click the Home button on the front center of the iPhone and your changes will be saved (just like when re-arranging icons).", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-make-folders-and-group-apps-on-iphone-2000100", "index": 0}
