I don't want to purchase one and have it not work Hovsep A July 3, 2013 at 9:06 pm pandora recovery?? http://www.pandorarecovery.com/ zoniweb June 28, 2013 at 7:09 am If data on card are not very important, than I suggest you to use RIGHT tool for formatting SD cards: SD Formatter 3.1 for SD/SDHC/SDXC https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_3/ It is free, btw. aTechMate.com June 27, 2013 at 9:52 am The best thing will be to perform a low level format on the drive/card: You can download the low-level formatting tool free from: http://hddguru.com/software/HDD-LLF-Low-Level-Format-Tool/HDDLLF.4.30.exe Read more about it from: http://hddguru.com/software/HDD-LLF-Low-Level-Format-Tool/ Mike Henderson June 26, 2013 at 3:30 am The above answers are all correct, but I'm wanting to know if they card ever functioned in the capacity stated? Who is the manufacturer and is it covered by warranty? I would begin by formatting it on the device it is to be used in (camera). Are you seeing the correct amount of images for the size of the card and the resolution your camera is set for? If that doesn't work, you can try to format it from Windows as someone stated above. Its also possible that your computers OS and hardware can not read SD cards above the 2GB size. I wish you luck in your hunt for 6GB! k June 27, 2013 at 5:51 am thank you I just not kinda of iffy about reformatting it because I really don't want to lose all my data Jim Chambers June 26, 2013 at 2:22 am It sounds like you bought a knock off unit with cheap 2GB insides masquerading as 8 GB card. k June 27, 2013 at 5:50 am no, its a Kingston mostly used for my android phone it has been working fine until now Jim Chambers June 28, 2013 at 2:16 am Knock offs will have name brands like Sandisk, Kingston, etc. printed on them like the street vendors Rolex watches and Gucci handbags. Check the Hardware Ids in Details section of the device listed in Device Manager then Google it to find maker. Dany Bouffard June 25, 2013 at 7:20 pm You can try to reformat it with the HP format tool, Vennroxx June 25, 2013 at 4:36 pm You should Scan first with proper antivirus and then format it properly at least two times. Hope its helpful enjoy Justin Pot June 25, 2013 at 1:12 pm How old is the drive? Because if an 8 GB card reads as 2 GB, then stops working, you've probably got a hardware problem. You could try reformatting if it shows up in hardware manager, as said above, but it's like you just need a new card. Sorry about that, but luckily they've gone way down in price.. Oron Joffe June 25, 2013 at 8:16 am Plug the drive in and run \"Computer Management\" (it should be in Administrative Tools either in the Programs menu or in the Control Panel). Click on \"Disk Management\" in the \"Storage section, and the drive should be listed there in the bottom half of the window. If it is corrupt, it the partition will probably be shown as \"Unknown\", \"RAW\" or some such. Rght click on it and you should be able to remove the partition and recreate it, or to create a new one, and then to format it as FAT32. If it does not show up at all in Disk Management, check the device manager. If it is not shown there either, the card (or the reader!) is probably damaged, but if it is shown with an exclamation mark on a yellow background, or a red X over the icon, then the device driver is corrupt and you should either roll it back to a previous version or uninstall it and restart the PC and let it reinstall the driver afresh. Phill Duplessis June 25, 2013 at 6:42 am Go to http://www.freedatarecoverysoftware.org/memory-card-data-recovery.html to download memory card recovery software. k June 27, 2013 at 6:00 am I did good news is that everything shows up on there bad news is demo wot let me copy it to my computer...
