Select Touch ID & Passcode and then enter your passcode. If you haven't set up a passcode for your phone , you need to do it before you can set up Touch ID. Tap Add a fingerprint in the Fingerprints section about halfway down the screen. Press and lift your finger on the Home button several times while holding the iPhone as you do when you use it. When the phone has a clear scan of the center of your finger, it moves to the next screen. Hold the phone as you usually hold it when you are unlocking it and touch the Home button with the edges of your finger rather than the center you scanned. When the phone accepts the scan, the phone returns to the Touch ID & Passcode screen. Move the toggle switch next to any of the four options you can control with Touch ID to the On/green position.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/use-touch-id-iphone-fingerprint-scanner-1999206", "index": 0}
