Opting into this setting--usually selected by default--will include data for this conversion action in your \"Conversions\" reporting column. Data in the \"Conversions\" column is used by automated bid strategies like Target return on ad spend, Enhanced cost-per-click, or Target CPA. So, if you use an automated bid strategy to optimize for conversions, and you don't want to include this particular conversion action in your bid strategy, you can uncheck the box. Otherwise, leave the default setting. Unchecking \"Include in 'Conversions'\" for all your app install conversion actions will cause cost-per-install bidding to stop working properly.
