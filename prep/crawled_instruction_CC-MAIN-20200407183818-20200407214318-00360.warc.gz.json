In your Recently Used apps, touch the app icon for the first app you want to use in Split-Screen mode. It's located in the top, middle of the app card that displays in your Recently Used apps. From the menu that appears, select the Open in split screen view option if it's available for that application. Not all apps are available for split screen mode. If you tap an app icon and the option to Open in split screen view doesn't appear, the split screen option isn't available and you'll have to use the app in full screen mode. Then choose the second app you want to open in the Recent options, or you can select another app from the App List . If it worked successfully, the second app should appear directly below the first app opened and have equal spacing on the screen.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-do-split-screen-on-android-4707782", "index": 0}
