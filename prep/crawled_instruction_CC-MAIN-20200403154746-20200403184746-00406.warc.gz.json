If your VPN provider offers an Android app, you're in luck. Download the app, sign in to your account, and connect to a server. If your VPN provider doesn't offer an Android app, search the provider's website for their OpenVPN configuration files. They're usually listed under Linux support if you don't see a section specifically for OpenVPN. When you have your files, transfer them to your phone in whichever way is easiest for you. Go to the Google Play Store and search for OpenVPN for Android . The correct app will pop up. To be sure, the app icon is the OpenVPN logo with Android antennae. Install the app. Launch OpenVPN for Android, then tap the box with a down arrow in the top right corner of the app. Your file manager will open. Find and tap your OpenVPN configuration file to import it. You'll be asked for your VPN username and password. Enter them, then tap the box to remember your password. The OpenVPN app will connect to your VPN server and show you the VPN IP address. You're now ready to start work with Kodi.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-install-exodus-on-kodi-android-4178095", "index": 0}
