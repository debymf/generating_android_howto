Tap Settings . Tap Wi-Fi . Tap the i icon next to the Wi-Fi network name. Find the Router field and write down the number listed there (this is the router's IP address ). It is probably something like 192.168.0.1, but could be something else. In the Safari web browser, go to the IP address from the last step. You'll be asked to log into your router. You'll need the username and password you created when you set up the router. Hopefully, you wrote this down somewhere. It's also possible that you didn't change the default username and password. In that case, it could be something as simple as admin/admin. Do some Googling for \"default password for [your Wi-fi router model]\" if you need guidance. Once you've logged in, each Wi-Fi router model will have a slightly different set of steps for finding the Wi-Fi password, but look for settings or the name of the Wi-Fi network and you'll be on the right track.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/find-wi-fi-password-on-iphone-4177061", "index": 3}
