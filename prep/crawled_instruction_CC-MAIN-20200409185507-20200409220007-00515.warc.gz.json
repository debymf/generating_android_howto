Locate the text area where you want to place a bullet point list and double-tap on it. From the toolbar, tap the bullet point list icon to create your first entry. All edits to Google Slides save automatically in the background so you don't need to manually save after making changes. Type your text for the first point in your list and tap Enter on the keyboard to begin your second item. Repeat until you've completed your list. When you've added all of your points to the list, tap the blue checkmark in the top-left corner. Tap outside of the slide to remove all visual guides.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-add-bullet-points-to-google-slides-presentations-4584364", "index": 0}
