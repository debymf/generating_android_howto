You can also Control-Click the desktop or a folder in a Finder window, choose Import from iPhone or iPad, then choose Add Sketch. If you don t see the commands in the File menu, they may be in another menu (such as the Edit or Insert menu) or the app you re using might not support them. On your iPhone or iPad, draw a sketch using your finger; on iPad, you can also use Apple Pencil. When you re ready, tap Done. On your Mac, the sketch appears where you positioned the cursor or, if you started from the desktop, as a file to save.
