Perform your gesture on the recording screen. For example: Touch-and-hold gesture: Touch and hold your finger in one spot until the recording progress bar reaches halfway, then lift your finger. Be careful not to move your finger while recording, or the gesture will be recorded as a drag. Two-finger rotation gesture: Rotate two fingers on the iPhone screen around a point between them. (You can do this with a single finger or stylus just create each arc separately, one after the other.) If you record a sequence of taps or drags, they re all played back at the same time. For example, using one finger or a stylus to record four separate, sequential taps at four locations on the screen creates a simultaneous four-finger tap. If your gesture doesn t turn out quite right, tap Cancel, then try again. When you re satisfied with your gesture, tap Save, then name the gesture.", "url": "https://support.apple.com/en-ae/guide/iphone/iph96b21954/12.0/ios/12.0", "index": 1}
