Reply Funhouse123 January 6, 2017 at 6:41 am For anyone curious, you use your whatsapp on your mobile to scan the QR code for whatsapp web. Once you are far away from the computer or leave, the web app disconnects you from whatsapp and you would either have to have your phone within distance in a specific time frame, usually 1 minute, or if the phone is away for far too long you would have to reconnect by going back on the whatsapp on mobile and scanning the QR code again. In order to see if your whatsapp is connected in any other computer/laptop you just go to settings where the QR code is located and you can disconnect from any device. Either way, if you are spying on someone and they leave or disconnect you, you would have to start over again. Not that I spy, but I recommend immediately after connecting you download all conversations you can view in case you get disconnected and you need any sort of proof/information until you can get a hold of their phone again. There used to be apps where you could login into whatsapp with your phone number and password, but since whatsapp launched their web app many of them are gone. You can look around and see if any of them are still around. Reply Archa January 5, 2017 at 9:36 am how can identify previously logged whatsap session id from a deleted account?

Those Chrome extensions just simplify the access to official WhatsApp Web client. I have a button in my Chrome toolbar, I click it and after the traditional registration through QR-code I can use WhatsApp Web. Next time I should not repeat the registration. They do not replace WhatsApp itself. But I just try to understand which is better. Reply Evgeniy April 22, 2015 at 1:31 pm Dear Mihir Patkar, Thank you for the review. Despite there are many reviews for WhatsApp Web I find this one to be interesting. I am a novice WhatsApp user. This app is not popular in Ukraine. Viber kicks ass, as well as Hangouts does. I just started to study WhatsApp just to see the difference. So I found out there are a dozen of Chrome extensions to improve WhatsApp Web UX. I tried this one [Broken Link Removed] It's free. And almost all of them are free but WhatsApp Web Extension that costs about $1. I do not know why :) That extension does the same that free alternatives do. How do you find those extensions? Which is better on you opinion? Thank you! Reply Mihir Patkar April 22, 2015 at 4:39 pm Hey Evgeniy, thanks for the kind words. I wouldn't recommend using anything except the official WhatsApp Web client. WhatsApp has been banning accounts of people using alternative WhatsApp apps on Android, so it's best to play it safe with the Web version too. Plus, this way, you are guaranteed that your chats are encrypted and safe, which is a risk with third-party clients.

I am on my personal laptop on my home network, newest version of Chrome and have tried restarting and clearing my cache. Also tried turning off extensions like AdBlock and PushBullet but none made any difference. Any assistance would be appreciated Reply Mihir Patkar February 2, 2015 at 11:08 am Sorry Paul, I wish I could help you out, but I haven't experienced this myself or know anyone personally who has. Have you tried using it on another laptop and seen if it works there? That might tell us whether the problem is with the computer or the phone. Reply Paul February 2, 2015 at 6:41 pm Thanks for the reply Mihir, I'll keep trying to figure it out.

Reply Mihir Patkar February 2, 2015 at 11:07 am I'm not running XP right now, but can you tell me the Chrome version you're using? Reply Alfred January 31, 2015 at 10:11 am Opening web.whatsapp.com in Chrome on a PC produces a QR to be scanned and everything works nicely. But on an Android tablet it suggest to download the WhatsApp Messenger which leads to the Google play version that is not compatible with the device since it is not a phone. How should one navigate around these obstacles? Reply Mihir Patkar February 2, 2015 at 11:02 am Yeah, it won't work on Chrome on mobile operating systems (Android, iOS, BB, etc). You'll need a desktop operating system (Windows/Mac/Linux) to use this. Reply Yacine January 31, 2015 at 3:00 am so im conected to whatsapp web , then my phone loose connection , i was hopping to stay connect to whatsapp web as long as i still have connection inmy computer , even if i lost connection in my phone !!!! thats the only way in my opinion that will make this new thing more fun to us as users :)))) otherwise i don't see any reason why people should use it . Reply Daniele January 31, 2015 at 8:42 am For example, if I have to write long messages, it's more confortable writing them with a real keyboard instead of the smartphone virtual keyboard. I also can copy & paste text or links directly from my PC (i.e., I read an interesting article, and I want to send an excerpt and the link to the entire article). And with Whatsapp Web I can send images and videos I have on my PC (in the hard disk, in a network share, in a USB key, ...) without need to transfer them on the smartphone. Think it as an extension of your smartphone: you could connect a real keyboard to the smartphone to write faster and an external storage (USB key or hard disk, network share, etc...) to retrieve images and videos and send them; or you simply could use Whatsapp Web from your PC (and with a >=17\" LCD monitor vs. <=5\" smartphone screen! ;-) ).

Reply Mihir Patkar February 2, 2015 at 10:59 am I don't think so. I think the assumption here is that if you're using WhatsApp Web, you're connected to broadband and don't have data restrictions. Pretty silly, I agree! Reply himanshu January 29, 2015 at 12:27 pm Can any other person use my whatss app no on his desktop.

Reply Daniele January 28, 2015 at 7:24 am It would be nice to save conversation directly from Whatsapp Web, in a HTML formatted version, with colors, graphics and link to received or sent images, videos and audio clips, that could be later viewed in a browser (Whatsapp on the smartphone is only able to save a TXT chat, without emoji and without direct link to the files of images or videos). At current time, there's no way to save a well-formatted chat from Whatsapp Web. Do you know if anybody has developed a Chrome Extension to do this task? Reply Mihir Patkar January 28, 2015 at 9:36 am Hmmm interesting. A quick search didn't reveal any such extension. Hopefully if someone develops one, they'll drop a line here :) Reply N.R.

Reply Mihir Patkar January 27, 2015 at 10:51 am If you've whitelisted, it should be fine.

Any idea how I can overcome this? Reply Mihir Patkar January 27, 2015 at 9:24 am I don't think it works on tablets (unless you're using a Windows tablet).

WhatsApp on web do work on android tablets (need to check the \"request desktop site\" in browser though) but for some reason the layout itself forces parts of the code outside the screen view on my Nexus 7 as well (zooming out won't help) making it unable to scan properly... Very annoying. :-( Reply Jaffar January 27, 2015 at 7:14 am hi all, i didn't found \"whatsapp web\" option in my whatsapp plus.. can any one please suggest me to solve my problem.... Reply Mihir Patkar January 27, 2015 at 7:16 am It's only in the official WhatsApp app. In fact, WhatsApp is rejecting accounts of those using third-party apps like WhatsApp Plus, so you might want to consider shifting to the official client.

Reply Mihir Patkar January 27, 2015 at 5:49 am You can just log out from the Web app :) Think of it like your email. If you stay signed in, anyone can read it. If you log out, your privacy is guaranteed. Same thing here. Reply pmshah January 27, 2015 at 3:49 am So even in cloning the features of Viber they did a half baked job ! I really wonder why Viber has not displaced Whats app altogether. Viber is available on ALL platforms as also supports audio conversation. In fact I have managed to make it work on the combo of desktop + conventional ( read non- smart) mobile phone. Best part is, unlike whatsapp, it is tied to the number and not to the instrument. BTW audio conversation is still missing. Reply Mihir Patkar January 27, 2015 at 5:14 am I honestly think there are plenty of great IM apps out there which can give WhatsApp a run for its money. No idea why this one is more successful. Reply Bud January 27, 2015 at 3:29 am CAN T USE on an Apple iMac and recently read where Apple no longer supported it! Reply Mihir Patkar January 27, 2015 at 5:13 am No, that's false information. It doesn't work in iPhone, but iMacs are fine. I've tried it on my MacBook and it's super smooth. Basically, any iOS product won't support WhatsApp Web, but any Mac product will. It's not a total lack of support on all things Apple.

Reply Mihir Patkar January 27, 2015 at 5:11 am WhatsApp hasn't officially said why, but some sites like The Verge are reporting it's because iOS restricts background multitasking and push notifications.

Reply Mihir Patkar January 27, 2015 at 5:10 am Nope, you'll need the camera to scan the QR code, so I don't think you can do that. Reply Anonymous January 26, 2015 at 10:30 am I am a little concerned, as I have just connected my WhatsApp Web after removing all WhatsApp media from my phones memory. You know, so any the pictures in the chats appear blurry and when pressed, they show the message \"Sorry, this media file doesn't exist on your SD card.\". But once I connected to https://web.whatsapp.com/ , all my pictures automatically loaded up. I'm not happy with this as they are obviously stored somewhere without my knowledge or consent. Is there any way around this? Reply Bikas January 26, 2015 at 5:33 pm Try clicking any of the image. If image is there a big version is shown or else, the same no image message pops up. The images you're seeing are mere thumbnails which may not be actual image. Reply Mihir Patkar January 27, 2015 at 5:10 am I'm curious to hear about this. Bikas's logic seems sound, so could you click a thumbnail and get back to us?

Reply ibnsina May 7, 2015 at 9:07 am I have the same problem. Just point your camera as if you were not seeing the screen. Point it making sure your objective is in front of the code and at a distance so the QR code would fit into the square green box. The problem is that the image shown on the screen is shifted to the right and so the left black part is in fact the result of spanning the left margin. Reply Kumar Mullackal January 26, 2015 at 5:11 am The best part of it is, once you are home on your desktop or Laptop you can confine yourself to that alone for updating your social networking. And Google input tools work too ! Texting in regional languages in their primitive type writer layout on the desktop itself is an added advantage. Would be appreciated on having more controls from the web version itself like deleting posts and so. Hope this technical issue will be taken care of ! Reply Mihir Patkar January 27, 2015 at 5:06 am I think you can expect those features to roll out slowly through updates, Kumar. I don't see what is preventing them from letting you delete conversations or exit groups through the web interface right now. I actually hadn't thought of the use of regional language, that's a fantastic point!

Reply Bikas January 26, 2015 at 5:30 pm Whatsapp Web is just an interface to the mobile app. Messages are still sent and received on mobile device. Whatsapp Web will only provide you convenience of big screen of laptop/desktop. Reply Mihir Patkar January 27, 2015 at 5:04 am Like Bikas said, the mobile app is still carrying out all the sending and receiving. That's why your mobile device needs to be on. It's not just that it needs to be connected to the net, you also need it to be on--if your battery dies, so does whatsapp web.

Reply Bikas January 26, 2015 at 5:23 pm Hangouts sync the message with data on Google server. WhatsApp web only syncs messages temporarily and data remain on device. Data transaction still happens on mobile and not on web, it's just an interface. iPhone is not capable for such feature. Reply Mihir Patkar January 27, 2015 at 5:00 am Bikas is absolutely correct here. Comparing WhatsApp with Hangouts doesn't make sense here because the WhatsApp web app is still talking through your phone, not directly to a server.

Reply Mihir Patkar January 27, 2015 at 4:59 am How do I talk with all my friends on WhatsApp if I use Telegram? With social networks and instant messaging apps, it's more about \"what is everyone I talk to still using?\" I have no one in my regular contact list who uses Telegram but doesn't use WhatsApp. More than half of my contacts use WhatsApp but don't use Telegram.

Reply Mihir Patkar January 27, 2015 at 4:57 am That's strange. Please clarify what is happening and we'll try to sort it out together :) So you can see the QR code on screen and when you point your phone's camera to it (through the WhatsApp Web app), nothing happens? Reply Simar January 27, 2015 at 1:14 pm Hi, Yes! this happened with me too. Please try the following steps: Reload the page: web.whatsapp.com. This would bring a new set of encrypted bar code image and then you can again click on : whatsapp web {please make sure to log out from your device first before performing this step}. I realized that, i am keeping the phone scanner mapped to the web image quite close. When i moved the mobile little far away {still in the bar code focus}, it immediately picked up. One change that i have noticed is that: Web whatsapp doesn't allow you to change your profile picture OR commonly known as: DP- Display Picture...If i have to change, i would need to do this form my mobile. Same goes in for the display message: is doesn't show nay on the web side. Reply Simar January 27, 2015 at 1:23 pm Hi All, Few questions: If whatsapp web is a web interface of the mobile app {therefore we need to be connected on our mobile}, why are we not getting Setting tab as present on our mobile to be a mirror image on web too? As per the feature of \"Last seen online\"- this was something as applicable to mobile..is this same when connected in web side as well? If so! i am connected OR online on web so, would all my contacts see me online all the time even if i have a different setting of last seen online on my mobile? How is this feature synching? Reply Soumik January 30, 2015 at 12:26 pm Same with me....and cant seem to get over it...
