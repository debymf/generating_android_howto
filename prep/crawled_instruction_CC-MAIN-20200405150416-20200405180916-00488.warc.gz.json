In the menu that pops up from the bottom of the screen, tap the name of your HomePod. When the call is switched to the HomePod, an icon of the HomePod will appear in the Audio button and you'll hear the call audio coming from the HomePod. Because you can't use Siri to place calls, you also can't use it to end the call either. Instead, you can either tap the red phone icon on the iPhone's screen or tap the top of the HomePod.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/make-phone-calls-with-homepod-4163581", "index": 0}
