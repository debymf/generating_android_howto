You ll need to change your settings to get replies individually. Go to Messenger Advanced settings Click on Group Messaging Select Send individual SMS messages to all recipients. Only you will get any replies Hope this helps and thanks for commenting. =-) Reply Baba on September 21, 2016 Hi Carol: My situation is a bit different. I have an android smart phone. At this moment, all that I need is to send a text message to one person, and the same text message to be sent at the same time to a second party as an email. At this time, the message is to be sent to just two parties (one party receives it as a text message, and the second party receives it as an email). Purpose: for your worship house, I need to send a text message one member, but I need to copy the treasurer the same message as an email. Please advise M-USA Reply Judy on September 22, 2016 Hi Baba, I don t think that s possible. Anon on September 28, 2016 You could probably do it with Tasker, but you d basically have to build the app yourself. One text input field and a send button that initiates two actions: one sending the text from the input field to a specific number, the second sending the text from the input field as the body of an email to a specific address. I d add some extra functions too: write the text field to a file every N seconds, as a backup and to be loaded automatically on scene open; this file could be cleared on successful sending. A button/automatic saving to a local text file as well. Autofill the email subject line, say Automatic copy of txt to to treasurer, . Etc etc. Depending on your skill level and how polished the end result needs to be it could take from a few hours to a few days (even months) to create. Steve on December 16, 2016 Yeah, but Go SMS is a great app and it works if you enable group messaging. You don t HAVE to use it, but it works if you WANT to use it.

Reply nicole on January 25, 2015 The Go SMS Pro app does not work with my Virgin Mobile phone. Are certain carriers unable to support group text??? Reply Dani on January 30, 2015 Nicole, I don t have a phone on Virgin mobile, so I can t test it out myself, but after a little research here are a few potential solutions: go to settings. go to more settings. go to mobile networks. click on network mode. select cdma. it will reboot your phone. and it should allow you to send messages. Unfortunately cdma mode only works through 3g, so you have to sacrifice with this method. Another possible solution: Settings>General>MMS Size Limit. Change the limit size to 1M if it s not already there. Reboot the app and see if it works. If these don t work, look through the settings and try to find some MMS settings that might be causing the problem. Try writing up a bug report to Go SMS Pro to see if they can help you out. Reply Carolyn on September 23, 2019 I am having the opposite problem with my Android. My group texts don t show other contacts, so when I respond to one contact, everyone gets it, but no one knows why they are getting the message because they don t know they are on a group text. This is so annoying. Reply Daniel on September 25, 2019 Hi Carolyn, that s the issue with replying to a group text. It s best to create a new message with that specific contact than replying to the group message. Otherwise, everyone who s included in the group message will receive it. Reply Sandra on February 26, 2015 Many android phones have a limit on the number of people you can text simultaneously. My current Samsung Note 2 has a limit of 10; a Sony Experia Z3 I m considering buying has a limit of 50. The explanation here about how to create a Group for your contacts to enable group texting (sometimes called mass texting or multi texting) doen t explain that many android phones have an inbuilt limitation on the number of people you can multitext in the software. I have looked at Go SMS Pro; but users Feedback comments are scathing about the most recent upgrade. I have also considered Handcent; but similarly, users are incredibly dissatisfied with the most recent update. Both sites have comments about their most recent App updates that would make it impossible for me to use their App for my multitexts. (I arrange wildlife rescues and need to text 100 people simultaneously. My current Samsung phone has a limit of 10 people per multitext; so I have to send the text 10 times; which is time consuming and frustrating.0 I don t need to group chat; in fact it would be counter-productive. I haven t looked into GroupMe yet; but will. Any suggestions in the meantime? Thanks Reply Dani on March 10, 2015 Sandra, Have you tried this app? It comes with a 2 week trial. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mittelmanapps.bulksmsfree Keep up the great work you are doing! Saving wildlife is amazing.

But I delete conversations on a daily basis. Once I delete the group MMS conversation I don t get any new replies from any other iPhone recipients, if there are any. Furthermore, if I create a new group MMS with the same recipients, say a week later, I still don t get replies from iPhones. It s not until all group participants delete that group MMS thread, then I get iPhone replies. It s frustrating. I guess the moral of THIS story is: don t delete the group MMS threads!

If one of them goes into the group thread and then try to send a picture, they claim it never sends. Is this a typical problem with GroupMe, or could it be something else (perhaps my settings?

Reply nancy on June 6, 2015 Is it true -if you switched to an android from iPhone. Your friends recognize your number as an iPhone user and responds with a iPhone messaget that you don t get. I went to iTunes and dissociated my number with apple. I hear ithe takes awhile before your number is forgotten as an iPhone then your friends I phones will see you as an android and send correctmy formatted messages Reply JOA Team Sam on June 6, 2015 Hi Nancy, This was the case few months back. It drew a lot of press news mentioning that Apple intentionally locks down the users to their iMessage so that competing platforms like Android users suffer. However the good news is Apple responded and provided a way around for this. If you still use your iPhone you can go to Settings > Messages > iMessage > OFF. If you have already switched to Android you can use this page from Apple website to deregister yourself. Hope this helps.

Reply David on December 22, 2015 I send out a weekly text message to 70 plus men. Some with android and some with iphones and of course various networks. The text is sent from a Galaxy S6 on Verizon network. I recently got the new phone in the past month. Prior to this I was using a Galaxy S3 and having no issues other than having to forward or resend the same text message out 4 times from the stock texting program. Since I have begun using the new phone I am still limited to sending the message to 20 people at once, but now the entire text is not being received by everyone. Some receive the entire message but some receive only a cut off version. Maybe some are receiving the message as an mms and some as an sms? So two questions would be how do I get the entire text message to go through to all recipients and a plus would be if I could send only one text message to everyone in my men s group text.

There could be some incompatibility issues since I am guessing that the S6 has a more recent Android version than the S3.

Google didn t work, so I created it under BAP. And it shows that the group exists. But when I try to find the group in my contacts to send out a text, it is not in my contact list. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Reply megan on August 29, 2017 Hi, Keith. Is Backup Assistant Plus an app that you downloaded? If so, you may not be able to access the group you created except within the app. You may also need to make sure that BAP has the necessary permissions enabled to make a group and for you to access it. Could you expand on what happened when you tried to create a group using Google? Reply Debbie on August 11, 2018 I have a Samsung J7 and my family all have I phones. Afyer a recent update they nowonly receive one third to a half of my text messages. Any ideas on how to fix this? The AT&T rep told me it was because iphone didn t play well with Androids and uses I-messaging. The only suggestion was to buy an i-phone. Reply here on November 1, 2018 Hmm it appears like your website ate my first comment (it was super long) so I guess I ll just sum it up what I had written and say, I m thoroughly enjoying your blog. I too am an aspiring blog blogger but I m still new to everything. Do you have any suggestions for inexperienced blog writers? I d definitely appreciate it. Reply iTunes error 1671 on November 10, 2018 Nice idea I am also looking for the same that you shared in here nice post I am also looking at the same I am using both device iPhone or Android and your article very helpful for me. Reply Drew on November 13, 2018 Why does everyone always comment and say I m having the exact same issue as you are! My phone is doing the exact same thing as your s is! What s the damn point in writing that? If you don t have a solution or a fix for the problem then why are you even writing anything at all? There should only be one message saying what the problem is and then a whole bunch of answers or opinions or ideas or solutions. There are literally 30 replys and all of them say I m having the same problem.. Same problem here.. My phone is doing that too.. Me too.. I have the same phone as you and mine is doing that too.. I just don t get it at all and it s not just on this site, it s literally every single forum on the entire internet! It s so irritating. I have to scroll through like 30 of the exact same comments just to get to someone who s posted something that may help my issue or someone who is actually talking about what actually might be causing the problem. STOP ALREADY! PLEASE! Reply android application on December 14, 2018 A lot of people still prefer text messages as the best way to keep in touch with others. Well, they are quick and reliable. You can be almost sure that the message will reach the recipient. Reply Clement Essien on December 22, 2018 Great Post, will like to link it. Reply Tom on December 29, 2018 Is there an Android app that does not support group MMS messaging at all, i.e. only does SMS texting? Reply David Lime on February 16, 2019 Hi thank you for such very helpful information. Am starting a sms marketing business and that will really help me. Reply Div Jangid on March 9, 2019 Great Post. You can also use bulk sms software to send messages in bulk. Reply Rahul Rema on May 8, 2019 This is a very great suggestion particularly to those new to blogosphere, short and accurate information.

Reply David Cook on June 13, 2019 If I send out an MMS group text from my Android phone, one of the people I list in the group does not receive the text. She has an iPhone X. What messaging setting on her phone is most likely the one blocking her receipt of my group texts? Other iPhones in the group are receiving the texts. Reply Kate on August 30, 2019 I just got added to a group text, the author created from her android and everyone seems to be receiving the text. There is one number listed under the group name and everyone is freaking because they think its a phone number (scam) and I think the group has some kind of ID number. How can I check that out. I did google the # and it did not come up as a valid mobile phone . Reply Daniel on August 30, 2019 Hi Kate, Googling a phone number will not be helpful at all. Even if it s a valid number, if it s not registered to any company or person online, then it will appear as an invalid number. What you can do is block the number to stop receiving and prevent the group from sending anymore text messages to it. Reply Donald on September 30, 2019 How can I see previous messages from a group text that is no longer available? Reply Daniel on October 1, 2019 Hi Donald, unfortunately, you can t view previous messages anymore from a group text if it s no longer available. You may need to view them using the phones by individuals who s included in the group. Otherwise, you may have to use other means such as recovering deleted text messages.

Reply JOA Team Lace on November 27, 2019 Hi there! Thank you so much! Reply Darla on January 12, 2020 Thank you for this clearly explained article. It validated that I have the correct settings (Group texting MMS enabled). I have a OnePlus and use the Messages app from Google. My success in sending and receiving group texts is spotty at best. Frequently, photos will not download. Sometimes text responses will not download, and occassional my responses will not upload to the group text. I get a perpertual Sending status under the message to be sent. What is going on? How can I get group texting to function correctly? Any guidance would be most appreciated! Reply Themm on February 26, 2020 Very well explained article, appreciate your help! Reply JOA Team Yuri on February 28, 2020 Glad to hear, Themm Reply Douglas Miller on March 14, 2020 I have an android smartphone. I am a member of a text group and recently I ve started getting replies from some members of the group, but I don t get the original text (so I don t know what the replies I do get are referring to). This has just started happening a couple weeks ago. I use Google Messages and Mysms and it happens on both. Any ideas? Reply Rene Williams on March 15, 2020 I searched my entire phone and no results for MMS . Galaxy J7 Neo, Android 9.0. Reply", "url": "https://joyofandroid.com/group-messaging-android/", "index": 1}
