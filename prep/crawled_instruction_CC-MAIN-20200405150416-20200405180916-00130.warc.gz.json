Many issues that cause software errors can be addressed with a simple restart. On most Samsung Galaxy smartphone models, press and hold the Power button and choose Power off . Once the device is off, allow the smartphone to sit for at least 30 seconds before powering it back on. If this step doesn t resolve the Camera Failed error, proceed to the next step. Check for system and app updates. An outdated system or apps that need to be updated can cause the Camera Failed error. To check for system updates: Go to Settings > System Updates . Tap Download updates manually . Your system will check for available updates that have not been installed. If there are any, install the updates before proceeding through the remaining steps in this section. To ensure your apps are all updated, go to the Google Play Store and tap the three bar menu in the upper left corner. Tap My apps & games from the menu that appears and make sure you're on the Updates tab. Tap Update next to each app or tap Update all to update any apps that have updates waiting to be installed. After updating, check your camera to see if the error is resolved. Power up in Safe Mode. To start your Samsung Galaxy smartphone in Safe Mode : Hold the Power button until the Power Off menu appears, then press and hold the Power off option until Safe mode appears. Tap Safe mode to restart your phone in Safe Mode. Check to see if your camera is working properly. It if is, the problem could be a third-party app conflicting with the camera software. Restart your phone in regular mode and remove recently installed or updated third-party apps one at a time until the problem disappears. You may need to restart your phone after removing each app to ensure all parts of the app have been removed Third party apps are one of the most frequent reasons that other users have found they receive the Camera Failed error, so don t skip this step. Force stop the camera and clear the storage data . From the Home screen go to Settings > Apps > Application manager > Camera app, then tap Force Stop . Next, go to the Settings > Apps > Device Maintenance and tap Storage . In the menu that appears, tap Clear Data or Clean Now to clear out your cached data. Once the cache is cleared, restart your camera and try to use it to determine if the error has cleared. Remove , then reinsert the microSD card . Occasionally the Samsung Galaxy smartphone cameras will encounter an error reading the microSD card which can cause the Camera Failed error. To resolve the error, power off your Galaxy smartphone. Remove the microSD card. Power the phone back on and reinsert the SD card. If prompted, reformat the microSD card. Reformatting a microSD card will erase all the data on the card. If you have pictures or apps on the card you don t want to lose, try transferring them to your computer using a microSD card reader. Turn off Smart Stay. Smart Stay works by using the front-facing selfie camera to monitor the position of your face while you re looking at the screen for a long time without touching the screen. Because this uses the camera, it can sometimes cause a conflict if you try to use the rear camera at the same time Smart Stay is active. To solve this problem, turn off Smart Stay. Go to Settings > Advanced Features and disable Smart Stay . Now try the camera again to see if the problem is solved. Clear the cache partition . Although you ve cleared the app storage cache, there may still be some cached data causing a problem with your camera. To clear the cache partition: Turn off your Galaxy smartphone. Reboot the phone holding the Bixby button, the Volume Up button, and the Power button simultaneously . Continue to hold those buttons until the phone vibrates. It should now boot into the Android recovery screen. On the Android Recovery screen, use the Volume Up and Down keys to navigate to Wipe Cache Partition . Select the option with the Power key. When finished, restart your phone and try your camera again. For Galaxy versions that don't have a Bixby key, Step 2 in the rebooting process is a little different. Hold the Volume Up , Home , and Power buttons to restart the phone and continue to hold the Volume Up and Home buttons until you see the Android recovery screen. All remaining instructions apply to all versions of Galaxy smartphones. When all else fails, do a hard reset. If nothing has worked up to this point, the last thing to try is a hard reset. To do so, go to Settings > General Management > Reset and choose Factory data reset . This will return your phone to factory settings and you ll have to go through the entire setup process as if it were a brand new device. A Factory data reset will erase all apps and data from your phone. Be sure you have a backup of any information that you do not want to lose before you begin the factory reset process.
