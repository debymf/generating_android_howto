They are the full 12 Megapixel size in iPhoto but whenever I copy the photos from iPhotos to a folder in Finder, or copy to an email, they reduce in size! It is so damn irritating that I can't simply send the original file. Reply Ra Ra November 25, 2017 at 5:53 pm This article was so helpful. I was tearing my hair out trying to figure out how to resize my image. Thank you for writing such clear, informative instructions for non techies like myself! Reply reybo April 24, 2017 at 4:08 pm NONE of the options below are in Photos v1.5 for El Capitan. The Export allows no change of the image in Photos. [No Size function there] Under Size you can choose Full Size, Large, Medium or Small presets, and Custom allows you to set your own size (in pixels). Choose Custom to specify a maximum Width or Height, or choose Dimension to limit both width and height to the number you provide. Reply Tim Brookes May 5, 2017 at 4:32 am Photos is currently on version 2.0, and the above tutorial works perfectly (I just double checked it). I suggest you update your Mac or try again? Reply Gregory252 November 12, 2015 at 1:23 pm That is why I always prefer to do the things with a Photoshop instead of any other program. All other softwares are not good as Photoshop and for me personally it is the most simple solution. Image Size menu have everything for perfect resizing photos so who is beginner maybe can check this tutorial : http://pc-problem-solutions.blogspot.rs/2015/11/how-to-resize-photo-in-photoshop-cs3.html . Do not complicate your life with useless things like photo resizing... Reply bunny June 5, 2011 at 7:06 pm Actually, even though resizing appears to be simple two-click process in Preview, images continue to PRINT out in the full/original size rather than at the \"resize\" selected. Does anybody have a solution for that. Reply Egqegwe May 15, 2011 at 1:18 am It should be as simple as File-->Resize then it takes you to a dialog that says \"Height __ PX\" and \"Width __ PX\" Reply Egqegwe May 15, 2011 at 1:25 am Even easier, you can use Preview instead of iPhoto, then go to Tools-->Adjust Size. iPhoto is junk Reply Bakari March 29, 2011 at 2:40 pm OttifantSir, I m not a Mac fanboy trying to defend Apple s products. There are many times I get just a frustrated as you about why certain features or processes are missing in Apple software, or any software for that matter. As for resizing photos in iPhoto, I m personally don t see it as difficult as you describe. I read your comment two times, and maybe I m missing the point and the specific problem. I apologize for not seeing that. Why do you find selecting a photo and clicking File>Export, and choosing a resize option as such a huge problem? Could suggest a better way that it could be done? This is a real question, not a defense of Apple. IPhoto is not Photoshop, but on this particular case, I m sorry but I m just not seeing your point. Finally, please don t take my response as one of arguing with you. I m just trying to get clarity about your concerns. Reply OttifantSir March 23, 2011 at 8:44 pm No resize tool available for Apple's iPhoto? And it costs money? This really shows that Macheads are just a bunch of cult-mmbers under The Church of Jobs. And they will now come and defend their precious program, saying it can resize, and how could I not have read the article, just the headline. I DID read the article. There's two ways this article describes as ways of paying (if you didn't spend some extra money already when you bought your Mac) to resize your pictures: Email them, or export them. Preferrably to a different format it seems. But I am not interested in the POSSIBILITY of resizing pictures with iPhoto. Every Apple-fanboy and -girl out there says Mac is SOOOOO easy to use. \"You just sit down, and presto!, two minutes later you're surfing the Web with the same ease as someone who's spent days, or even weeks, configuring their Windows-PC. And don't start me on that geek-only OS Linux. Who the h*** wants to mess around with settings on their computer?\" I am interested in the USERFRIENDLINESS of iPhoto. And this article shows me iPhoto ISN'T userfriendly. I can't tell how many times I've met limitations on image size online. If I had had a Mac, I wouldn't have been able to post those pictures. Macheads again: \"But you can just email them to yourself or export them!\" Yes, and after a while I might have found out that. But I also have more than 20 years experience with computers, and I know that if you're looking for a tool, it's not always obvious, and the menus aren't there ONLY for the professionals. But, take my family: Mom needed practically a two-day course in using Picasa. My sister doesn't even know how to install/uninstall a program without a 7-page booklet from me with pictures. My father doesn't care about computers, except for being pro-Windows. My brother can't be bothered to learn anything besides setting up Call of Duty and play that. Somehow, they all take pictures and load them onto their PC. Sometimes they upload them, and sometimes they need to resize them. I know what the reactions would be to iPhoto. Mom: Can you help me resize my pictures? Why do you do that? Why isn't there a button or choice to resize? (Two days later, on the phone) How did I resize my pictures again? You got to come over and help me. Now. Sis: I tried using it, but I wanted to resize some photos, and couldn't, so I gave it up. D***! POS program can't even do that! It was so easy in Windows (Paint.net, Picasa, Gimp, built-in, etc), why is it so hard on a Mac? I'll never again use ANYTHING from Apple. Dad: What does it do? Show pictures? Can it do more? Email pictures, huh? That's a nice touch. (Three weeks later, on the phone) My buddy can't see the pictures, they're too small. I tried using the other choices, but then he can't receive my e-mail, it's too big. Can you help me? Brother: (Six months later) I just tried importing my pictures to iPhoto a few months ago, but something went wrong. I don't know what, and I haven't tried anymore since, so I don't know if it's fixed or not. (I sit down, he tells me what he did, no problem importing) Huh, guess it's fixed then. (Three months later) The day after you helped me with iPhoto, I tried importing some other pictures, and the fault came up again. Can you come over some day and fix it again? (I know, importing and resizing are two different things, and importing pictures is available and easy in practically all image editors. But, that's my brother's view) As you can see, there's a point to this story: I am the geek, and I am expected to know the solution to all their computer problems, even if I, as in the case of Apple-products, have never owned or used any of them. And also, if Macs are supposed to be so userfriendly, then why hide one of the most important and easily implemented features under the un-intuitive heading of Export in a menu. Why not right-click? Oh, that's right. Macs don't have two buttons on their mouse. If you want a right-click menu, you have to CMD-Click. (I wonder if that's the reason why, after 20 years of Windows and Linux experience, when I try a Mac at a computer store, it's impossible to do anything but look at the background and the dock. I know they're locked down to some degree, but I should be able to open the programs to see the interface, right?) (Climbing off my soap box....) In short: Thanks for showing the world how idiotic Apple is in their GUI-decisions. Reply Christian Hagen March 23, 2011 at 7:44 pm No resize tool available for Apple's iPhoto? And it costs money?
