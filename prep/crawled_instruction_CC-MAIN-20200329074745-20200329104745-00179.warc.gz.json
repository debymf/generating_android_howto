Sukanya S June 6, 2013 at 7:50 am These are all old methods, these used to work before but they don't now. Akshay Hallur June 4, 2013 at 7:23 pm this will help u.. hank May 30, 2013 at 1:36 am to the author of the site you need to fix lines 13 and 19. you have not ended the cod coment. its stopping the html from linking to the css Tina Sieber May 30, 2013 at 8:25 am The author of which site? TommY May 25, 2013 at 12:34 am I think there aren't actually real files on that survey sites, it's all fake... Real files would be through adf.ly or something like that, but on standard site like mediafire, rapidshare etc. cydiahelper560 July 4, 2013 at 8:19 pm Actually not. WHY? because if they upload to mediafire or rapidshare it can be public and it wouldn't work for more like 3 days. thats why they have surveys to make sure that it isn't gonna be removed or discovered by internet security guys or whatever you can call them Mrhelpfulnew May 1, 2013 at 9:21 pm Take the survey remover from SKIDROW. They are a very popular hacking group. You can get it here for free: mediafire.com/?bbv58892wmlhaq5 bmbm May 12, 2013 at 4:58 am yeah and after you open that rar they ask to complete a survey to get the password. it's just all the same PKE May 13, 2013 at 10:14 am Any way to bypass Fileice Surveys Sukanya S May 15, 2013 at 1:27 pm It seems to me there is no actual way to bypass those surveys, how sad MG June 11, 2013 at 5:35 pm You know what you get on that page? Invalid or Deleted File. The key you provided for file download was invalid. This is usually caused because the file is no longer stored on MediaFire. This occurs when the file is removed by the originating user or MediaFire. Still have questions, or think we've made a mistake? Please contact support for further assistance. Em April 29, 2013 at 7:04 am http://akshayeminem.blogspot.com/2013/04/how-to-bypass-surveys-to-download-files.html this can help you.. gav April 21, 2013 at 9:42 am this person says that he will upload the mediafire file soon http://fileicesurveykiller.blogspot.kr/2012/08/fileice-survey-killer-bypass-fileice.html Mike April 8, 2013 at 10:57 am Don't waste your time on these survey sites, even if you complete or bypass the survey you'll probably never get the promised files, just a bunch of spam and ads instead. Or how about a nice piece of spyware, a virus or a costly monthly subscription to an online service you'll never use ? These people earn money by enticing the greedy, the dishonest and the gullible to submit their mobile phone number or an email address. When someone says to you \"Hey, tell me your name and I'll give you a million dollars\", do you believe them? Hmm... I thought not. You might also try being honest and stop trying to get something for nothing (ie stealing). Much safer and a lot cheaper in the long run. You'll sleep better at night. Anne Ahnomus April 18, 2013 at 10:43 pm Actually, there is a legitimate need to bypass these survey sites. Some files (listed as free) are only available from such sites. Can't find them anywhere else, even if I'd be willing to pay!! For example: http://hackersuniversity.com/the-sims-freeplay-hack-cheats-trainer-tool.html Find that item on a non-survey site. Some say they don't require surveys, but after the download, it requires a password to unlock the zip or rar - and to get the password, guess what? Yep, you have to visit a survey site. Alan Wade March 5, 2013 at 12:51 pm I have got to go with MUO TechGuy's response, its by far the easiest route! pratyush March 4, 2013 at 1:00 pm just go to http://survey-remover.com/ and get the bookmarklet and skip survey Anonymous March 5, 2013 at 5:30 pm well that used to work before, but they don't work now. the survey makers also got smarter, i think. Muo TechGuy March 4, 2013 at 9:07 am Stop using such pathetic sites, and switch to torrents or Usenet. Herobrine August 2, 2013 at 5:20 pm I agree that torrents can get you pretty much ANYTHING without surveys but they are just a big of a pain in the ass. Sukanya S August 7, 2013 at 6:23 am How can torrents help? i don't use torrent much coz i don't know much about them. MakeUseOf TechGuy August 7, 2013 at 8:11 am (1) Get a torrent client (2) Go to piratebay.org (3) Enjoy. I do not condone piracy, just education! susendeep dutta March 3, 2013 at 6:31 am Try the web service in the below link - http://surveybypass.com/ Surveys are used by many to earn money from it. Anonymous March 5, 2013 at 5:33 pm not working dude. tell me how to use it. susendeep dutta March 8, 2013 at 9:58 am Simply copy the URL of the survey site into the textbox and press enter.This will skip survey of the site.

Sukanya S July 11, 2013 at 3:55 pm This site does not work anymore. :( Susendeep D July 12, 2013 at 2:13 pm Then try the tips mentioned in the link below - http://surveykiller.tumblr.com/ anon August 21, 2013 at 9:46 am you do know that it only goes back to the survey site and doesnt give you the download? Unknown ... March 3, 2013 at 4:32 am That's not possible dude. You're stuck there. These people are lame. Don't even pay attention to those gay surveys. There are plenty of other options available. ha14 March 2, 2013 at 4:22 pm well i think is not possible, unless the person who uploaded the file give you the permission to bypass the test. shadow June 5, 2013 at 9:38 pm he/she is asking for help so if you don't have a valid answer then don't post anything. they did not ask a question just to be told they can't do something.", "url": "https://www.makeuseof.com/answers/what-is-the-best-method-to-bypass-fileice-or-fileurl-surveys/", "index": 0}
