Reply Judy on July 28, 2016 Hi Kris, If you have downloaded the AS + SDK bundle: By default, the SDK should be located in C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Local\\Android If it is missing at this location, one of the following reasons apply: you have chosen a custom location, you missed to install the SDK at all, or (unlikely) they have changed the default install location. Note #1: the AppData directory is hidden by default. If you have a standard Windows configuration, the path I gave about should work as is (hit Win + R -> paste the path -> Enter). Note #2: you will never find the SDK in the Android Studio directory unless you have explicitly put it in there. If you have retrieved the standalone SDK by some other means: The SDK location may vary (from my experience), however (assuming the default configuration) you will most likely find it in C:\\Program Files\\Android or C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\ Hope this helps and thanks for commenting. =-) Reply Miguel on July 30, 2016 can i unlock my phone if the USB Debug is not Enabled?? obviosly i cant activate that because my screen is broken and the tactils functions are not working Reply Judy on July 30, 2016 Hi Miguel, This should help. =-) https://joyofandroid.com/unlock-android-device-with-cracked-or-broken-screen/ Thanks for commenting.

The whole point of this exercise was to access a black screen phone how in the h are you supposed to Enable USB debugging if I could do that why the h would I need to do this entire process???????? Reply Trevor on November 1, 2016 there are other uses for ADB. Issue a number of commands for debugging, shell creations, port forwarding, and viewing general information about your Android device. Copying and pushing files from connected devices. Installing applications from one connected device to another. Gain more control over your device as a developer. If you have a broken screen and are talking about accessing the phone with no screen, yes it is an option, but you need the debugging on already. Most phones and versions of the OS let you turn it on, but debugging is only active when you plug in a USB to the phone. Reply Tanya on December 16, 2016 Trevor, you stated that most phone and versions of the OS let you turn on the debugging. The person above your paragraph though asks you the obvious (which is my question too). Since this post is about unlocking a phone with a black screen, if the debugging isn t enabled, how are we supposed to enable it? Is there a way to do this , so that SDK Android software can unlock our broken screen phones? I run all the above process and the command prompt answer I got was no devices/emulators found although my phone is connected to my laptop with a USB cable. Any more suggestions please? I would really appreciate any further help. Thank you. Reply Trevor on December 17, 2016 It s sort of like having a flat tire when you are driving, if you don t have a spare tire in your car already, you can t change it without the help of a service center or tow truck. For most phones, the debugging is in the developers menu. To turn this menu on requires you to go to the settings of the phone and tap the build number of the phone seven times (usually in the About Phone tab). So, to more directly answer your question, no, there is not a way to easily turn on debugging if your screen is broken, black or otherwise not functional. The same scenario goes for items on your phone, if you have not set up a backup program prior to losing your phone, you ll be hard pressed to get the information off of it if it s lost or broken. Reply Dave on December 23, 2016 Is there a company or organization that takes care of all this? I have a Casio C771 Commando. It is locked because my daughter attempted to get into it. It is not activated. I will not do a factory reset because it defeats the purpose. All I want is my pictures. I can t unlock it because my google account password has changed since the phone was deactivated. I ve tried hundreds of different passwords, nothing. I can not get past the unlock screen. Any suggestions? Companies that I can ship it to? Dave Reply Trevor on December 23, 2016 Your phone will need to see the internet for it to verify your Google account password. This connection could be Wi-Fi or cellular. To my knowledge, no there is not a service that will use ADB to remove your images. In some cases, cell phone stores have celebrite devices that allow information removal from phones. Are the images stored on an external micro-SD card?

Habits are the place to sit tasks that you want to encourage yourself to do but which you don't want to get thwacked for if you don't do them daily. Note that which category you put something in depends entirely on what you're trying to achieve and what you feel comfortable with. Some people find it works well for them to add some tasks as habits first (so they can experiment with getting used to the task without getting constantly thwacked for non-compliance) then switch them to dailies once they've got a bit of a momentum up. This will lose the streak value but if that matters to you, you can fix that using the 'Fix character values' tool. The other thing habits are useful for is situations that happen more often than once per day. If you want to thwack yourself every time you light up a cigarette or reward yourself for every 30 mins you spend studying then habits are the go. As someone else noted, habits can be positive, negative or both and which you want to use is up to you. For smoking you could give yourself a '-' every time you lit up, a '+' every time you wanted to light up but didn't, or both.

The key is that you don't have to have a plus and a minus on a habit. If you click on the minus while editing it it'll get grayed out and go away, leaving you with nothing but reward. This has worked really well for me, and is perfect for those things that aren't everyday essentials, but you'd like to do more of. For instance, one of my habits is to do qi gong. I don't punish myself for not doing it, but I reward myself when I do. On the other side, I have a negative-only habit for when I eat sweets. In fact, out of my 11 habits only one has both plus and minus ( go to bed before/after midnight). Another thing I'd like to throw in is how great it is to customize which days a daily repeats on. For example, I have karate Tuesdays and Thursdays, so I have a \"pack your gear\" daily that only shows up on Mondays and Wednesdays. HabitRPG is dope.
