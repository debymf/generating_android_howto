Sign in to your Google account if asked. Choose iOS, Android, or Web. We'll use Web for this article. You might also see a Terms of Service and Privacy Policy screen. Go ahead and read through those things and accept them with the Continue button. On the page that asks about choosing a Google Voice number, enter a city or area code to get a phone number from that region. Review the numbers presented and then choose one to use as your Google Voice number by clicking/tapping SELECT . If you want to see more than the few that are shown by default, choose the LOAD MORE button under the numbers. Verify your existing phone number with the VERIFY button on the following page. Enter the phone number that Google Voice should forward incoming calls to, and then click/tap SEND CODE . Check your phone for the text message from Google, and then enter that code on the Google Voice website in the text box that reads G - . So, it'll look something like G-9820 . Click or tap VERIFY to confirm that the code has been entered correctly. Choose CLAIM to confirm that you want to forward Google Voice calls to that phone number. If Google Voice is already forwarding calls to that phone, setting up a new Google Voice number with that phone will remove the phone from being used with the previous Google Voice number (i.e. calls that used to be forwarded to your phone from another Google Voice account will stop ringing that phone). This is only an issue if you've used the same phone with another Google Voice number from a different Google account. Use the FINISH button to finish setting up Google Voice, and then click FINISH again on the final screen to open your Google Voice account.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/how-google-voice-works-3426682", "index": 0}
