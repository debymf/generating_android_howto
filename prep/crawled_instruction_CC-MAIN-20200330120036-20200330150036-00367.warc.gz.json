I made it myself, pin-5 is cut, and the battery was charged before I cut it and worked perfectly no holding it in place or anything. It is an official Sony PSP 1800mAh battery pack. From what I've read the battery could not be making a connection (even though it worked before) so I still tried and pressed it in and tried to manually turn the PSP on. That still does nothing. The connection is made because when I plug my PSP into charge and then put the battery in the light goes from Green to Orange (So my PSP isn't bricked either because it boots). When I go into the battery information with the battery plugged in it says this... Charge Level 0% Hours Left - Power Source External Battery Status Charging Also from what I've read, even if I didn't make the MMS correctly when I plug in the battery it should still turn on (Green light) and at least be a dead screen. Neither of which happen. I used PSPgrader 8 to make the MMS and I used the L trigger as the Tigger button and yet when I hold it in and then plug in the battery still nothing.

Can We make my battery to be pandora battery using pandora battery?.I so sorry if I inconvenience you.thanks Reply Simon Slangen September 20, 2009 at 7:52 pm You can find all this in the article. It is possible to make a MMS on your PC, if you've got a cardreader, you don't even need a PSP. It is not possible to make a Pandora battery with just your PC and an standard PSP, even if you have a working MMS. To get yourself a pandora battery you'll need to a) find someone with a cracked PSP who can help you b) buy a pandora battery or TOOL battery online - they're actually quite cheap c) hardmod your battery (this involves cutting open, and permanently ruining your battery -- not advised) Reply Newb User September 19, 2009 at 11:22 pm Hello Simon, i messed up and upgraded my psp 2 OFW6.00, is it in the making of being hacked so i can downgrade, i have a 1001psp or 1000 cant remember... lol Reply baboh_00 September 19, 2009 at 7:43 pm hello... please help me.Can I make my memory and my battery to be magic memory and pandora battery without use another memory magic and pandora battrey, Imean useing software on my windows only?. and I mention my version 5.51. thank you so much.

Thanks Reply Simon Slangen September 18, 2009 at 3:25 pm Yep Reply Fryguy|M| September 6, 2009 at 4:29 pm Well I just completed downgrading a psp-1001 w/ Official 5.1 update down to 3.8 and am now looking into updating the homebrew. This is a great guide! One thing, after you've made your MMS(Magic Memory Stick) and modding your pandora battery... at the point where you insert the battery: MAKE SURE you hold down the LEFT TRIGGER while inserting the battery and release the trigger when the Memory Stick light begins to flash, or else it will just boot up like normal (at least it did with my version). The guide didn't mention this or at least I didn't see it. Also, actually hardmodding the battery was pretty sketchy, all the videos I watched to see how to do it were all showing PRE-opened batteries and it wasn't easy the first time around. You really have to go slow and saw away at the seam all the way around the battery casing. Paying special attention to the top 3 prongs on the battery because I almost broke mine off trying to get the battery case apart. Luckily it all worked :) Thanks to all that contribute to this and all you crazy programming folks. Good luck to all. Reply OishiKyoki August 28, 2009 at 9:30 am This guid is incredible, i've used nearly every possible method for modding my friend's as well as my multiple psp's and this guid has all of THE BEST methods. On top of that, dependable download links for the m33cfw and ofw 1.50 are also available! you people rock! i bow in respect to your magnificence -_- for everybody else just be careful about updating! always grab your new cfw updates from trusted sites (sony ninjas and saltry Dark Alex enemies have placed bricker (fake) cfw everywhere) Reply Sarju August 20, 2009 at 2:57 am Hi I bought Pandora battery with LED and 8 gb memory stick from pandora sales. Battery has been fully charged and I hold the L1 button when I put in the Pandora Battery. I then click LED button 3 times on the battery (to change it to Pandora mode) and the lights on the battery starts flashing (to indicate it is on Pandora mode). However at this point I should see a green light on corner of PSP light up and something on the screen. However, in my case, the PSP remains shut/switched off with no lights except that on the Pandora battery flashing. I have PSP slim v3.90 and having checked extensively on the net, I have confirmed I should be able to install CFW on my PSP. I also remade the MMS using Rains UltraLiteMMSMaker and re-tried but experienced the same problem. Could you please advice on what the problem could be. Thanks in advance for your help.

To check if you've got a TA-88v3 motherboard, look for a white sticker on your box and check the printed letter. This will indicate your firmware, as well as your production line and thus your motherboard. (No Letter) = 3.60 A = 3.71 B = UNKNOWN C = 3.72 D = UNKNOWN E = 3.80 F = 3.90 G = 3.95 / 4.01 (TA-88v2 / TA-88v3) BUT A PSP with the 4.01 firmware and up installed is most likely a TA-88v3 motherboard as well. The above tutorial won't work. q: I turn my PSP on and get a blank screen, even though the battery indicator is green! a: This means your battery is modded, but there's something wrong with your Magic Memory Stick. Go over the steps again, or check the updated PDF guide (link at the top of the article). Alternatively, you can search for other MMS techniques with Google. Reply Majestique July 26, 2009 at 9:32 am After a little research I could semi-crack my psp using Chicken R2. However if I switch it off it will go back to its original shape. There is no risk getting it bircked and you don't lose your warranty because you can return it to its original firmware. I recommend it. And it also works for PSP 3000. Thanks for your answer Simon. Your full crack method is good but I had to use a semi-crack because it doesn't work on mine. I hope this is good news to some of you guys. Reply Majestique July 26, 2009 at 9:47 am Now to add the description. First of all you should know that all you have to do after hacking it, is not turn it off but use it in stand by mode. Don't take off its battery or its memory card. You can easily re-hack it when it turns to its original shape. The hack is for 5.03 firmware. First you use Chicken R2, then you use hen v2 which installs the program on it. Chicken R2 is a folder of some pictures which allow entrance to the ram of the PSP when you try to display them. Later your PSP restarts with the new custom firmware. You go to the games folder and install hen v2. After you install it you press left or right button only once to display the firmware. Then you press O to restart it. And you're done. You can play iso and cso games on it. There are videos on youtube that describe the installing. Good Luck. Reply Majestique July 24, 2009 at 8:27 pm Hi. I didn't have time to look at all comments in order to find out if there is an answer to my question so i appologise for that. I own a PSP slim 2004 with a system software version of 5.03. I took it to a place and they said that it can only be semi-cracked meaning that if i shut it down or take off the battery, it will return to its original form. I agreed and they cracked it for me. I played for a few days and i kept leaving it on Stand By until one day the crack went back by itself. I'm sure I didn't switch it off or removed its battery. I am in another country now and there is nobody that knows how to do that again. Can you please help me crack it or semi-crack it myself? Thank you. Reply Majestique July 25, 2009 at 10:35 am I'd also like to add that my memory card is an 8 GB card.

Reply Mike June 13, 2009 at 8:37 am OK guys i found a way to know ur PSP is not a TA-88v3 Motherboard... first get ur PSP box and on any of the sides there is a white sticker on the white sticker you will see a letter... for example the sticker of mine says CEL PSP-2004 Is 220-240v E now as u see above u will see A letter alone mine is E... Locate it and check the Letters below... (No Letter) = 3.60 A = 3.71 B = UNKNOWN C = 3.72 D = UNKNOWN E = 3.80 F = 3.90 G = 3.95 / 4.01 (TA-88v2 / TA-88v3) BUT A PSP with G and the 4.01 firmware is most likely a TA-88v3 motherboard and can u guess where i'am from 1.USA 2.Ethiopia 3.Greece 4.Italy 5.Arabia Reply gina June 26, 2009 at 4:11 pm I have a psp slim 2003 4.01 and my magic letter is J on the box.

If not specifically mentioned (CFW or M33), you can assume it's the original firmware. 2. No, the tool battery is for Pandora use ONLY - that's why it's so cheap. 3. There's always a slight chance. Not a big one, though. Reply Mike May 26, 2009 at 3:35 pm Okkkkkay i got ma questions in lists so plz answer them in No's 1. Are the firmwares u gave us 2 download CFW? 2.

Reply Simon Slangen May 25, 2009 at 11:20 am If you succeed in downgrading, yes. Then you can reverse the battery back to normal. If you fail to do so, you'll have to find another way. You can also buy a TOOL battery (see article) which is specifically designed to serve as a Pandora battery. That way you won't have to risk anything with your normal battery.

Reply Simon Slangen May 21, 2009 at 2:53 pm Easy on the caps. Both might work, although there are problems with some of the PSP-2004 motherboards. Best way to find out is to try it out, just make sure you're able reverse your battery if it fails. Reply Mike May 23, 2009 at 2:53 am wat do u mean \"reverse your battery if it fails\" or should i borrow ma friends 4.0v battery :::::::::::: Reply Simon Slangen May 23, 2009 at 8:07 am You need to make your battery into a 'pandora battery' to attempt downgrading. Afterwards, you need to find a way to reverse it to a normal battery, otherwise you won't be able to boot your PSP with it. To reverse your battery, you either need use your own (modded) PSP, or that of a friend.

Reply Simon Slangen May 21, 2009 at 1:09 pm The application can only be used on an already hacked PSP. You either need to find one of those, or use an alternative method.

I was trying option 1. I followed your instructions to make the memory stick which was - download the 4 files - put the pan3xx folder into E:\\PSP\\GAME - disable USB mode then run the program from the PSP game->memory stick - and select the \"repartition...\" from the MemStick and MS-IPL options Everything went well until the restart. After i restarted the psp (when it asked me to do so), the memory stick was renamed to \"PANDORA\"(instead of it usually being \"Memory Stick\") and it was completely empty. i still created the E:\\PSP\\GAME and again put the pan3xx folder in it and i also put the 3 PBP files in the root (they were in the same area as the PSP folder). I tried to run it now, but then i went to Game->Memory Stick, it said that \"There are no games\" where the pandora installer was suppose to be. PLEASE HELP ME!!! By the way. I am using my friend's psp (cfw 5.00 M33-3) and a SanDisk Memory Stick Pro Duo 2.0GB (Magic Gate).

Reply Simon Slangen March 5, 2009 at 11:07 am Perhaps you own one of the incompatible PSPs? What's your model number? Reply Frosty March 5, 2009 at 7:27 pm Not sure which model I have but its a fat (phat) psp, and I heard all of those models are compatible. StuC March 3, 2009 at 5:14 pm Firstly your patience for helping others is very commendable Simon & all other contributors refreshin to see\\read. Havin had 2 modded psps stolen, I have had them replaced with PSP-2003 PB Black dot and G on the barcode one running Version 4.01 and the other is 4.05 (i think son has that one). tricky to get hold of phat cfw (2weeks til lend friends); so considering the Tool Battery from amazon and 512mb card to complete the cfw install.. just wanted to get a thumbs up that these methods would work on this model and firmware.. seems to have changed so much since lasted d\\graded; days of using GTA:LCS was sooo much easier ;-) Many Thanks, Stuart Reply michael March 3, 2009 at 9:57 am do i still need to download the OFW 1.50?

Reply Simon Slangen March 3, 2009 at 9:56 am When opening nandtool, you should see a 'install cfw' or 'restore' option. Reply Diego March 2, 2009 at 10:58 am Hi, i have a PSP 2001 official CFW 4.01. i have the magic stick and battery made a long time ago, but they both work fine, because i use it on my fat psp and the menu shows up to upgrade to 3.80 m-33. i put it in my slim, and the same thing shows up. ok, its going all well so far. but when i change the settings so that the menu for downgrading to 1.5 shows up, it only works on my psp phat, and not on my slim. my problem is that when i put the memory card and battery into the slim, the menu for downgrading does not want to show up, but the menu for upgrading to 3.80 CFW shows up. can i just put \"upgrade\" to 3.80 CFW even though i start off with a 4.01? or do i have to find another way to downgrade it to a 1.5 first? thanks Reply Simon Slangen March 2, 2009 at 3:29 pm Yes you can, and once you're on 3.80 CFW, you can upgrade to 5.xx CFW. Reply Diego March 2, 2009 at 6:07 pm crap. did i say 4.01 CUSTOM firmware? i meant to say OFFICIAL firmware. can i just upgrade is from a 4.01 OFFICIAL firmware to 5.xx CUSTOM firmware? sorry for misunderstanding Reply Diego March 2, 2009 at 6:54 pm also, did you skip the step where you have to install ms0:/MSIPL.BIN to the memory stick? because i tried your method (which is different from the one i use currently) and when i put the memory stick and the battery inside the phat psp (havin problems with slim) nothin comes up. Diego March 2, 2009 at 7:05 pm sorry for the \"spam\" but i am still having problems. here are the instructions that i followed: Part 1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPwlrAZa69c and Part 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4ILLn9aotU there are files that you need to download at the right side of Part 1. after i do all of this i decided, wait, dont you have to DOWNGRADE before you upgrade to CFW? so in the options menu in Pandora Installer program(the one i downloaded from that guys video(his and yours are different)), there is an option to put the \"1.50 downgrade\" option in the menu when you put the pandoras battery in the psp. i try this on the phat, it works, but i try it on the slim, and it doesnt work. can i just go from 4.01 official firmware to 5.xx CUSTOM firmware? Dano February 27, 2009 at 10:06 pm I folloed the steps to make the battery using PSP 1001 CFW 4.01M33 and it said \" sucessful in making Pandora battery. I put this in a PSP 5.02 OFW and I just get a black screen. I put the battery in my CFW fat PSP and I get a black screen. Any thoughts?? Reply Simon Slangen March 1, 2009 at 5:09 pm The problem lies most probably with your mms. Try remaking it with PSP Grader (thanks to Dusty).

Also check my other reply (two or three posts up) about the progress on those motherboard types.

I am starting to get very annoyed because i have sent them numerous emails and they haven't even had the decency to email me back they don't have a phone number to ring, they are a very frustration company to deal with!! Reply mac February 12, 2009 at 8:13 pm Simon, the one who tried hacking my psp2006 said that the board of my psp is same as the ones of psp3000. he said that the only option left for us is to wait until the time comes that it becomes hackable. is it true? i hope he s wrong. i can t wait to play with my psp. if he s right, can you tell me when will the crack of that board be perfected? Reply Simon Slangen February 17, 2009 at 2:34 pm I haven't heard anything specific about the PSP-2006 having an unhackable motherboard, but the possibility exists that some of them have. To answer your other question: There is a method to downgrade the PSP-3000, and other PSPs with that motherboard. Only thing is, you can t use it. Sony took Datel to court after the latter anounced their little blue tool - a service battery that s claimed to work even for the non-crackable PSP-3000s. Read more about it here... Reply mac February 18, 2009 at 7:44 am thank you very much simon. i hope this case will be resolved in favor of the ta88v3 mobo owners. i hope this will really be the answer to my prayer. thanks simon. Reply Anthony February 12, 2009 at 10:55 am hi simon i tried it an it did not work i formatted the memory card then opened rains uploaded the eboots created the mms and then pressed left trigger to activate it and nothing happened Reply Simon Slangen February 12, 2009 at 3:20 pm Hmmm... Are you sure your battery is modded correctly? (Does the PSP turn itself on when you insert it?) If so - since you don't have one of the problem models - I'd just try several different ways of making your MMS. There are tons available if you do a Google search. Reply mac February 12, 2009 at 7:06 am simon, it really did not work. we already used the \"rain\" thing but it still did not work. is there any other way? or can we burn UMDs with a mini dvd and just put a case on it? will it work? i hope you could make some suggestions. thanks simon. Reply Simon Slangen February 12, 2009 at 3:22 pm If it didn't turn itself on, the problem lies with the battery, try making it again - optionally using another way. You can't burn UMDs yourself, I'm afraid :-) Reply dar February 12, 2009 at 4:17 am hi simon, unfortunately the rain software wont work.huhu after inserting the pandora bats plus the Mems, it didn t turn itself on. so i think this psp has a ta-088 v3 board.. :( uhmm another question, can we create our own UMD's even if the psp runs at OFW? will it work? -thanks simon! Reply Anthony February 11, 2009 at 11:51 am any extra tips Reply Simon Slangen February 11, 2009 at 11:55 am Like I just said to Chino, you might want to use the new version of Rain s . Except that, everything you need to know is stated in the article. Reply Anthony February 11, 2009 at 11:49 am ok i will hope, pray and try i go for the Rain s Simple MMS Maker option as i can access one psp only. Reply Anthony February 11, 2009 at 11:25 am hi simon i have one of the psp phats and it has firmware 4.05 will that be unlockable? thanks Reply Simon Slangen February 11, 2009 at 11:39 am Yup, all Phat PSPs can be cracked. Reply Chino February 11, 2009 at 10:16 am after inserting the pandora bats, the result was just a plain black screen.. Reply Simon Slangen February 11, 2009 at 11:46 am This means that your Pandora Battery is working like it should, but your Magic Memory Stick doesn't. There are tons of different ways to make one, certainly one should work for you. Personally, I'd advise you to try making it with the 'new' Rain s UltraLite MMS Maker Reply Chino February 11, 2009 at 11:50 am ohh so there is a \"new\" MMS maker.hehe thanks, ill inform you as soon as possible..thanks simon!

Reply Big_C February 10, 2009 at 3:54 pm I have a psp 2001 OFW 4.05, was led to believe that it un hackable(due to the 4 million psp hacking sites) every one has a different way (basically all the same) whats the best way? i made a battery and an mms(green lite, black screen) the serial number is a AB02*******-PSP2001, i read that u can't hack them (in reguards to s/n AB02)but on this site you say that the only unhackable psp is the 3000, coincidently... if this is true, i suck because i purchased a phat psp because i read that they are hackable no questions? Appriciate all the assistance, this site rocks! Reply Simon Slangen February 11, 2009 at 9:03 am I'm sorry, the information above is slightly outdated. The unhackable PSPs are the PSP-3000 and the PSPs with a TA88v3 motherboard. This includes the PSP-2001 and PSP-2004 with OFW 4.01/4.05 pre-installed. Fear not however, for these motherboards are on the verge of being cracked.

I'm a newbie and my new psp slim with OFW 3.80 so i follow your guide part 2 option 1. Question 1 - My battery is the original Sony Li-ion 1200 mAh (model S110). Your compatible battery listed: Sony standard Li-ion 1800 mAh. So can i proceed to make this batt pandora? Question 2 - I used a CFW PSP to creat the magic memory stick successfully. the pandora installer gave a msg that TA085 mainboard cannot make pandora batt. Will i damage my batt if i try? Thank you Reply Simon Slangen February 10, 2009 at 10:31 am I wouldn't try it with your 085 if I were you, you might risk ruining your battery. You need to use another, Phat PSP (not a slim). You also won't be able to use your Slim battery, simply because it won't fit in a Phat PSP.

(i've followed several other guides also with pandora installer and also the rain mms maker, still no luck though >.<) Reply ada February 4, 2009 at 12:28 am forgot to mention the psp 2001 is on a 4.01 OFW Reply Simon Slangen February 4, 2009 at 6:15 am Try using the new Rain s UltraLite MMS Maker .

Another pretty good app is UltraPandora Installer . It's more closely related to the original Despertar Del Cementrio releases, perhaps this would work for you. I'll also look around some more, to check out if it is a 2001/2003 specific problem like the comment below implies. ada February 5, 2009 at 8:32 pm still no luck with it working. gabzy1 February 6, 2009 at 3:18 pm Same problem here akmal February 3, 2009 at 4:22 am Hi Simon, Been reading your discussion with others about this unbrick thing. You seem pretty genius in this matter in which I really hope you can answer my dilemma. I'been searching all over for this few days about PSP 2000 Slim. Which if I'm not mistaken by now, it come with with 2 kind of motherboard, the hackable and not hackable. Thanks to you and others for sharing this interesting topic. At the moment, I'm trying to downgrade my PSP that came with OFW 4.0. What I understand, it stil can be done only if I don't have the motherboard they use for PSP 3000 (if my understanding is not mistaken). My big question is, HOW do i know/check what kond of motherboard my PSP used?? Really appreciated your answer in this. Reply Simon Slangen February 3, 2009 at 6:39 am Look at your PSP model number (like said in the article). So basically, you can use any PSP, except a: - PSP-2004 with a TA88v3 motherboard - PSP-3000 or above If your PSP-2004 came with either FW 4.01 or FW 4.05, it s almost definite that you have a TA88v3 motherboard. Reply ady February 3, 2009 at 7:04 am And PSP 2003 models? Reply akmal February 4, 2009 at 1:39 am Sorry if I'm sound a bit dumb. I read somewhere in other forum, that PSP 2000 have two kind of motherboard. The one that bought after November 2008, have a big chance been installed with the TA88v3 motherboard. But there also a chance it's still usea the old one. I did checked the label under the UMD door, it only write PSP 2000 Slim a the end. Can you tell me how to check the motherboard label. Thanks. Reply Simon Slangen February 4, 2009 at 6:11 am Nope, only those I mentioned above are troublesome. Saul February 2, 2009 at 1:27 pm Hi Simon I have followed your guide, creating my hardmoded battery and MMS; but I only get the black screen and green light; does this mean my battery works and the problem is in the MMS?

(Since you had linked CFW 5.00 M33-3 with the OFW 5) Reply Simon Slangen January 19, 2009 at 10:07 am Nope, the 'parallel firmware' is still FW 5.00, so go ahead. Reply Max January 22, 2009 at 8:05 am One other question dude and I know its a noob question but i could'nt find the answer anywhere.When we install a firmware upgrade on a psp where does it store all that data (of the firmware and all its new features) in the hard disk or the memory stick. The reason i am asking this is because if I change my memory stick and put in a new one , I am worried i will go back to vanilla psp slim (that is OFW 3.6). Reply GTO January 22, 2009 at 8:11 am It's installed onto the \"internal harddisk\" called FLASH. So you can freely change your MMC with another one, and you can also (after installing CFW) format that memory that you used for installing that particular CFW (notice that you can, but you don't have to do it if you have another MMC). Greets, GTO Max January 27, 2009 at 11:50 am Thanx dude Max January 27, 2009 at 11:53 am BTW why cant the psp 3000 be downgraded with a pandoras battery? Since I am planning on buying one. mike January 16, 2009 at 7:19 pm ihave a psp-2003 with 401 firmware and have create and pandoras battery and mms but when booting all i get is the green light i have tryied this on my other psp phat and it works any ideas Reply Alvin January 15, 2009 at 8:41 am i am using version 5.02 in psp,my game are not works in memory card when i upgrade..i m stuck what can i do? please tell me a way to solve this problem.. and send it to me my email address is kskalvin@hotmail.com Reply [J-@-/\\/\\] January 14, 2009 at 7:37 pm first, this is the best guide that i have found after weeks of looking. good work!! when i try to pandorize my battery it wont work. its a psp-2001 with 5.02 OFW. i have cut through the wire in 3 places and even cut the little peg off. it just wont do the pandora thing when it supposed to do the black & white screen!!!!! but it still works like normal. is my battery screwed or what? or am i just doing it wrong? Reply Simon Slangen January 16, 2009 at 2:01 pm The pandorization of your battery surely failed if you can still boot your PSP like normal. So you either did something wrong or have an incompatible battery. If you're sure you did everything right, you can help others by posting your batteries make and model number. Reply James January 14, 2009 at 6:15 pm I just wanted to warn people so they don't go through what I did: DO NOT buy from Pandora Sales. I ordered the 4 gb magic memory stick, and they sent me a fake card. If you bought from them, test the Magic Gate - if the psp says \"unknown\" rather than \"supported,\" it's FAKE! So they said they'd exchange it. It was a big hassle because I live overseas. And they didn't even refund my shipping to send it back. So about two weeks after they receive it, I get my new card in the mail. And it's real!! However, all of the files on the card are corrupted - making it useless for putting CFW on my PSP. I ended up reformatting and making my own MMS via Rain's memory stick maker. Here's some advice - much easier and a lot quicker to just do it yourself. Don't get scammed by Pandora Sales!

I have done numerious research before buying my PSP 2000 . Anyways got off amazon brand new and guess what .Its PSP-2003. So i have looked around about hacking/flashing it and i am a bit sketchy about what i have to do exactly. I have noticed that out of the box v4.01 CANNOT be hacked due to a new motherboard however i carefully took mine out and checked and mine is 3.95OFW. I have ordered my pandoras battery and MMS via pandoragadgets so i have emailed them to check, but can anyone actually clear my problem up for me? .I would like to downgrade.upgrade to CFW on my PSP-2003 v3.95OFW . Can i do this? If so how? Any feedback much appreciated. Reply Chinco January 8, 2009 at 9:46 pm I followed all of the steps for option 3.

I looked at pandoras downgrading guide (pandoragadgets.co.uk/news/2/Downgrading-guide.html). This is becuase i am going to buy both the MMS and the pandora battery. Once i get these should i proceed from (using your pandora battery). I feel your guide is better. Anyways i am not to sure about the downgrade process could you clear a few things up...as i am v4.05 where you say ''go to recover and choose to install the 3.80 Custom Firmware (M33).''. I would like to know if there is any specific reason why that one. And the updating procress. For example if i download any other updates...i could choose ''4.01 M33'' then put that update file here (X:\\PSP\\GAME\\UPDATE). Then continue the process for example? Last but not least if i had the latest update which you talk about in this guide it shouldnt affect the ability to uniquely customise my PSP, and install chat, radio, msn, wifi-catcher, homebrew capabilities onto your PSP so that i can run software straight off the memory card? Thanks again, its appreciated. Once again great guide (y) Reply anupam January 4, 2009 at 4:26 am will 1gb memory card will be enough for some good pirated games Reply Riley January 5, 2009 at 10:28 pm No I recommend either 4gb or 8gb Reply trouble_al January 3, 2009 at 10:13 pm hi simon i just downloaded an emulator pack looks good. lots to choose from here's where i got it from, check it out id like to get your expert opinion on it. pspmod.com/forums/emulation/44423-emulation-pack.html i've just join that sit too.

These come with Firmware 4.01 or 4.05 pre-installed. Your screen will remain black when trying to use a Pandora Battery.

Thnx in advance for answering and for making this simple for me! =D Reply Simon Slangen December 23, 2008 at 7:38 am The Pandora Battery uses parts of these original firmwares, not only to 'put together' the custom firmware, but also to change several things within your PSP. (e.g. it flashes Phat PSPs with the 1.50 kernel) In short, you're just providing the ingredients for a big, tasty CFW pie. Reply Joshua December 23, 2008 at 9:03 am Cheers, one more thing I missed, when I'm updating my CFW I have to rename them, I take it that the m33 version is the EBOOT.pbp and the official version is the 500.pbp? I know you said to do it like in '2.a' but I clicked on the link and got sent to part-1, then I couldn't find it and got sent on a loop looking through everything, I'm wondering if my phone is being a jerk(I know, I'm forced to use the internet through my phone, isn't that tragic). ANYWAY, could you just confirm or say it's the other way around please? Thnx again =D Reply Simon Slangen December 23, 2008 at 10:54 am Yeah, might get a little confusing.. ^^ EBOOT.PBP is the CFW, 500.PBP is the official 5.00 eboot. ishaan December 22, 2008 at 4:38 pm can i use the mms and the pandora battery on my psp normally after downgrading Reply Simon Slangen December 22, 2008 at 4:45 pm MMS: yes, just format it PB: Normally, yes. Method 1 can be reversed using the same application. To depandorise a hardmodded (method 3) battery, you'll need to do some soldering. Reply Simon Slangen December 22, 2008 at 4:58 pm My mistake, I meant to say option two. So to make your battery normal again: - Method 1: use the same app - Method 2: resolder the connection you cut through - Method 3: not possible Reply franco December 22, 2008 at 4:36 pm Is option one only if you need to modify a battery to make a pandoras? I already have a Pandoras I purchased online do I still use option 1?

Carl December 21, 2008 at 5:22 am I have been having a right nightmare with this. But cracked it. Im using option 3 with a pandora battery, and making my own MMS. What cracked it for me, was turning on the PSP with no battery, just the AC cable. Then once booted up, place the pandora battery in, and remove the AC cable. Follow the instructions above, then when completed, remove the battery, and replace with finger on the L button. I also got hold of Windows XP, but didnt try this method with Vista.

The pandorisation (nice word) using the first technique can be easily reversed, but if you decide to use the hardmod technique it won't be that simple.

These come with Firmware 4.01 or 4.05 pre-installed. Your screen will remain black when trying to use a Pandora Battery. If your 2004 PSP came with another Firmware pre-installed, you should be able to use the Pandora Battery specified in ifti's link. Reply burnt soul December 18, 2008 at 2:37 am Ok. I got PSP 2004. Bought new, this november with OFW 4.01. After reading whole tutorial and comments I came to know that PSP 2004 OFW 4.01 can be hacked and can't be hacked. Yes, like my comment, its now too confusing to know \"Will I be able to hack my psp?\" Because I don't know whats my motherboard number (or version). And how you people come to know which PSP 2004 (4.01) could be hacked and vice versa without opening it up. Or rather I should say you open it to know whats exactly does the motherboard says. Could you help here because after after applying all the processes and tutorial available on the net, I am still holding my psp with game demos ;) I would appreciate to get your fruitful answer, after so much hectic and win less efforts. Thanks. :) Reply Simon Slangen December 19, 2008 at 11:22 am If your PSP came with FW 4.01 of 4.05 pre-installed (and yours does), it can't be cracked. The community will catch up, but finding a way to crack these new mobo's takes some time.

But I guess you just want to get those CSO/ISO files started. If you've got a CFW PSP it'll suffice to put them in a X:\\ISO folder (with X being your PSP). Please only use these files if you have the original games in your posession. Not just because MUO disaproves piracy, but because it's wrong and you'll burn in hell for it.

Reply Simon Slangen December 15, 2008 at 5:57 am If you made it with through a CFW PSP, try making it using Rain's. If you've made it using Rain's, you could try and install one of the other Descartos versions (= other options in Rain s - e.g. DCv4). ifti December 12, 2008 at 5:58 pm hi, i am thinking of using option one but the which battery i should be using where is confusing. should i battery-mod the CFW PSP (phat) ie. my friends and put that in my psp slim. will that be ok ? or do i put my pspslim battery in the CFW PSP (phat) and mod that. how do i get the battery back to normal after i have flashed my slim PSP ? thanks for the guides. Reply Simon Slangen December 13, 2008 at 11:30 am Sometimes problems occur when pandorizing slim batteries. Not that it matters, your PSP Slim battery won't fit in your Phat PSP anyway. So: Phat Battery . Afterwards, the battery can be normalized using the same app. Just start the CFW PSP on A/C power, insert the Pandora Battery, start the application and normalise it. Reply ROD December 12, 2008 at 4:23 pm hi,simon i have a psp 2004 with original 5.02 firmware.I did the MMS and i have a pandora battery.But when i put the pandora in psp and i press the L button the green light turns on and nothing happens the screen stays black.Can you help me pls. Thanks in advance and keep it up. Reply Simon Slangen December 13, 2008 at 11:25 am Your pandora seems to be working (your PSP turns itself on when inserted, right?) so the problem is with your MMS. Are you sure you've done everything correct? If not, try again. Alternatively, if you made it with a CFW PSP, you can try Rain's Simple MMS Maker . Your last option would be to try and install one of the other options in Rain's (e.g. DCv4). Reply Paul December 12, 2008 at 11:35 am I wanted to use option 1 in your guide. But I can only get hold of a psp slim with a custom firmware 5.00 m33-3 can I use that? can i use the psp1000 s battery to make the pandora? pls help. thanks in advance.

Reply Simon Slangen December 9, 2008 at 10:35 am \"model psp-S110 Li-ion battery pack 3.6V=1200mAh\" These batteries CAN be hardmodded. For reference see the guide below, which specifically mentions the PSP-S110 battery. Are you sure you've followed the guide for the slim battery? http://forums.maxconsole.net/showthread.php?t=90959 Reply opy December 8, 2008 at 11:02 am Very nice guide! The best and most informative that I have seen. I just got a few PSPs on Ebay and managed to repair one so far. I upgraded to 5.02 to play with it till I got a good MMS and battery. I now have a MMS and I modded my battery and I can get to the menu to intall CFW 3.80. My battery wont charge, I can run my PSP from the A/C or USB charger but if it is unplugged then it shuts off. It will be at least a week before my new batteries get here and I want to play with the newest CFW now. My question is if I can get to the menu to install CFW 3.80 will I need a charged battery or will it just install using the A/C power? Also if I am running CFW 3.80 can up upgrade to CFW 5.0 without a charged battery or will it be like the OFW and require a fully charged battery to upgrade? Reply Simon Slangen December 8, 2008 at 11:28 am In theory, you can do both these things with just your A/C power, but for safety reasons (you're working with delicate parts of your system), some apps do require your battery to be charged over 80%. My guess is that you will be able to install CFW 3.80 with your A/C power (if you can get into the menu), but the CFW 5.0 upgrade will require a charged battery. I'm not 100 procent sure though, so you can always give it a shot. Reply opy December 8, 2008 at 11:37 am Thanks, that answered my question. Now to decide if I want to install 3.80 and play the ISOs I have or wait till a battery gets here next week or wait till I fix another PSP and experiment on that lol. One more question, I assume that withg the CFW you cannot access the PSN or do remote play right? If not I will just wait till I get another PSP working so I can have 1 original and 1 CFW. Thanks for all your fast, helpfull advice and this awesome tutorial! And I am extremely impressed with your patience with the noobs that cant read the entire tutorial before asking noobish questions lol. Reply opy December 8, 2008 at 11:53 am Odd, I left a comment but its gone. Thanks for your fast reply and help. Now I just have to decide if I want to run 3.80 for a week or just wait till I get another PSP repaired. I assume witht the CFW you cannot access the PSN or remote play, am I correct? If this is the case I will probly just wait to repair another PSP and have 1 OFW and 1 CFW. Thanks again for this awesome guide and links. Reply Simon Slangen December 10, 2008 at 5:07 am I'm not sure about CFW 3.80, but CFW 5.+ seems to be able to access the PSN.

Thanks for all, GTO Reply GTO December 8, 2008 at 6:46 am Feel free to delete this post (because you've answered before) Thanks for all :D Reply JAY_PABLO December 8, 2008 at 4:13 am Hi Simon, Check this excerpt. is it possible to modify a battery without opening it (Hardmod), just by using a software? someone sent this to me. Thanks for your previous reply. Keep up the good work. Cheers! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"\"- A spare PSP Battery. Any make will do. Using a spare is best, as it will not be possible to boot the PSP in its normal state with the modified battery. - A spare Memory Stick Pro Duo of less than 4Gb. (256Mb should be enough for all applications). - A PSP with a Custom Firmware such as OE, M33 or WC, or a PSP with the 1.5 original kernel. INSTALLATION PROCEDURE - Connect the PSP to the PC with the Memory Stick inside via the USB Connection. - Format the Memory Stick using any utility. - Use mspformat to format the Memory Stick logically. - Remove the Memory Stick and disable the USB connection. - Connect the Memory Stick again via the USB connection of the PSP. - Manually create the PSP/GAME (optionally PSP/GAME150) folders on the Memory Stick. - Copy the \"battery\" and \"installer\" programs to the PSP/GAME (optionally PSP/GAME150) folder. - Copy the 1.50 official updater as UPDATE.PBP to the root of the Memory Stick. - Remove the Memory Stick and disable the USB connection. - Run \"installer\" through the firmware on the PSP. This application will create the firmware files on the root of the Memory Stick, as well as msipl.bin. - Connect the Memory Stick again via the USB connection of the PSP. - Execute \"msipl\" application on the PC with the msipl.bin to write the IPL to memory stick. - Remove the Memory Stick and disable the USB connection. - Execute \"battery\" application on the PSP to modify the battery. - Congratulation, you are now in posession of a \"Magic Memory Stick\" and a \"JigKick Battery\". USAGE - Insert Memory Stick into the PSP - Remove power cord and insert the JigKick Battery into the PSP. - A menu appears when the PSP boots. Follow the onscreen information and instructions.\"\" --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Reply Simon Slangen December 8, 2008 at 6:26 am That's right.

Reply wh1t3b01sl1m December 7, 2008 at 5:29 pm Simon or any who can answer this question, Do I need to get a modded battery before making the magic memory stick or can i get it afterwards? and Once i have completed this entire process, will running the psp with a different battery or memory stick screw with the updated firmware? Thanks in advance. This guide was truly helpful, insightful, and creates almost no possibility for user error. Reply Simon Slangen December 8, 2008 at 2:10 am You can create the MMS afterwards, but you won't be able to start your PSP with a Pandora Battery, so you'll need to: a) Create the MMS, then the Pandora Battery b) Create the Pandora Battery, then the MMS, but don't restart your PSP in between c) Create the Pandora Battery, then the MMS with a different battery d) Create MMS with Rain's Simple MMS Maker and the Pandora Battery whenever you want When you have completed this proces, you can restore your battery and use any battery/MS your want. Reply wh1t3b01sl1m December 8, 2008 at 9:17 pm Well im choosing to go with option three meaning that i'll just purchase a Pandora battery rather than make my own. So i was just asking for further clarification: A. Can I create my MMS with the Rain app now with a regular battery? because im prepared to make the MMS now but i need some time to get the Pandora battery. B. If I can, will that MMS be functional with regular firmware for the period of time until i get my Pandora battery? C. And after i complete the process and have installed custom firmware, i switch back to my original battery but the i can keep the MMS and use it regularly? Thanks again. Reply Simon Slangen December 9, 2008 at 5:07 am The only thing special about a MMS are the files that are on it. Therefore: A. Yes B. Yes, but you would need to make it again once you've got your battery. (you need a 'clean' MMS) C. Like said above: \"The only thing special about a MMS are the files that are on it.\", so if you format it you'll have a normal MS. wh1t3b01sl1m December 9, 2008 at 7:28 pm A Pandora battery only puts the PSP into some kind of service mode, so I can not go into USB mode with one, correct? and So long as I don't save anything new to the MMS, it remains \"clean\", correct? I apologize for asking so many questions. Simon Slangen December 10, 2008 at 5:03 am No probs, Normally your PSP boots from the flash memory, with the Pandora battery it boots off the MMS instead. You should be able to use your Pandora if you start your PSP (with the A/C adaptor) without the battery inserted. Once started up, you can insert your battery and remove the cable. I'm not sure if this works with TOOL/jigkik batteries, though. About the MMS, just don't use it. You won't be able to play video's from it, save games, etc. without screwing it up. If I were you, I'd wait with the MMS until the Pandora arrives. Making it is really simple and goes rather quick. wh1t3b01sl1m December 10, 2008 at 11:29 pm Im planning on getting a Datel Tool, seems more legit. GTO December 7, 2008 at 4:49 pm Hi, i would like to buy a new PSP (Slim & Lite) but as i've googled all this night i've read that if i've got any G model i've get no chance of installing a CFW. But as i read here, the only thing that matters is that i've got a PSP lower than 3000 (the one that i saw is a PSP-2004NP or something similar). Thanks for this beautiful guide, i hope i could use it with my psp ^^ Greets! Reply Simon Slangen December 8, 2008 at 6:30 am The only reasons why you wouldn't be able to downgrade your PSP are: - if you have a PSP-3000 (or above) - if you're dealing with a NAND or other hardware error Reply GTO December 8, 2008 at 11:14 am Really? But i've read that some PSP Slim&Lite rev.G has some mobos that cannot be downgraded...so i'm not so sure if buying it now or wait until i can be done securely... Please help me, i want it and i want to downgrade it also... Do you think that if i will buy now the psp slim&lite rev.G i could install CFW? Thank you very much.

Reply Simon Slangen December 7, 2008 at 9:56 am If your battery is made correctly, your PSP should turn on automatically. If this doesn't happen, and if you can start your PSP like normal, there's a problem with your battery. Try again ;-) Reply JAY_PABLO December 7, 2008 at 8:56 am I also don't have any friend who has a downgraded PSP to assist me. PLS help! Thanks. Reply Simon Slangen December 7, 2008 at 9:23 am Please read the article or the comments above, both in which this question has be answered several times. This part of the guide consists of three sections, two of which you can still use. Reply JAY_PABLO December 7, 2008 at 8:51 am Hello Simon, Thanks for your helping out others. Pls i have a white-colored PSP Slim, Starwars edition. I recently upgraded it to VERSION 3.80. it came with a Sony battery 3.6v 1200mAh. I read your comments but there was no direct method for me to follow based on my software version upgrade and battery type. Could you please help me by giving me a step-by-step guide on how to START and FINISH this process. I greatly appreciate all you have done and will also greatly appreciate any help you can give me. I already downloaded some games but can't play them. Thank you in anticipation of your kind response. Cheers. Reply Simon Slangen December 7, 2008 at 9:28 am You can follow the guide above. You won't be able to convert your battery with Pandora Installer, though. Your options are: a) Buy a TOOL/jigkik battery b) Hardmod your battery or c) Use someone else's (phat) battery with the Pandora Installer. As I have told before, FirmWare version does not matter. All that matters is your PSP's version (no PSP-3000) Reply Simon Slangen December 7, 2008 at 9:33 am \"I also don t have any friend who has a downgraded PSP to assist me. PLS help! Thanks.\" Your options have then decreased to: a) Buy a TOOL/jigkik battery or b) Hardmod your battery (and buy a new one) Because one costs about as much as the other (but hardmod isn't always performed correctly), I'd advice you to buy a TOOL/jigkik.

Reply codongolev December 6, 2008 at 6:25 pm I did everything and when I put in the battery, I just got a blank black screen. what did I do and how can I fix it? Reply Simon Slangen December 6, 2008 at 6:54 pm A little more specific? What technique did you use to make your MMS? If you used a CFW PSP, try Mark Ashton's suggestion and run the MSIPL command while making your MMS. Does it work now? (if it works I might have to make a modification to the guide) If you used Rain's Simple MMS Maker, try my suggestion to Adam (a few posts up) Let s try to install another version of Pandora (the original one). We ll use Rainman s MMS Maker. 1) I suppose you already have Rainman s MMS Maker. Otherwise, download it now. 2) Download the 1.50 OFW if you haven t got it already. link 3) Select the target drive (PSP). To do this, you either need to use another (CFW/OFW doesn t matter) PSP, or a MS Pro Duo reader/adapter ((example). 4) Select the Format checkbox. 5) Press Make MMS Reply Mark Ashton December 6, 2008 at 5:09 pm P.S. Just to put to bed the rumour about the size of the card, I have a fully working MagicMem Stick on a 4GB Sandisk Pro Duo. Reply Simon Slangen December 6, 2008 at 6:38 pm Problems occur with >8GB (that doesn't mean it's impossible with them, just harder) Reply Mark Ashton December 6, 2008 at 5:08 pm Scroll up and read my post, I had the same prob as you. I think there's a step missing in the otherwise excellent guide above as I followed it exactly and it only worked after I 'fiddled' (see my post for details). I think you need to run the install MSIPL command after you've installed the DDCv4 MagicStick file (from what I've read this is needed to get the PSP to boot from the mem stick once the Pandora battery fires it up - correct me if I'm wrong Simon as I'm only just learning about this side of things so it's the blind leading the blind - all I know it that it now works!). When I have more time I am going to follow the guide again now I know what I'm doing and make 2nd Mag Mem stick (as I think this was the problem) using the guide. If it doesn't work I'll try each of my tricks in a row until I work out what it was that did it, then we know what the missing step is...or isn't! Main thing is, if you get the green light when you put the battery in you know the battery side of things is working correctly. By process of elimination this means that either the memory stick is not prepared correctly or FAILS TO BOOT (which I think may have been the prob)... You will prob need another PSP battery to get it to boot so you can get back to the Memcard maker screen as Pandora's Battery won't let you boot normally Reply Simon Slangen December 6, 2008 at 6:49 pm yodiddyumm has a jigkik battery (like a TOOL). This means he'll have to use Rain's Simple MMS Maker, which 'injects' IPL by default. Hence, this isn't the problem. Which does not mean it's not \"a\" problem. I'll look into it. \"if you get the green light when you put the battery in you know the battery side of things is working correctly.\" Correct. \"that either the memory stick is not prepared correctly or FAILS TO BOOT\" Which is kind of the same thing, but correct as well. Reply yodiddyumm December 6, 2008 at 3:14 pm i used the last step and made the mms and i have the jigkik but that black and white screen doesnt come on when put the battery and the mms in, what the hell i have this problem no matter what method i use to mod Reply Simon Slangen December 6, 2008 at 6:56 pm Try my suggestion to Adam and Colongolev.

Reply Simon Slangen December 6, 2008 at 3:18 pm Yes, you'll need to install CFW on it. If you scroll up you'll see a how-to. There are several tools available to back-up your UMD's (like Fastloader or UMD Ripper). These can then be booted by dropping them in an ISO folder on your Memory Stick (X:\\ISO). Try to use legal back-ups, game earnings are pretty harsh as it is. Reply Mark Ashton December 4, 2008 at 7:56 pm Hi, I followed your guide to the letter but ended up with black screen and green light. I tried again several times and was about to give up. I've now got it working, it started with just getting the Elf menu up so I started again as I realised I now had a working pandora battery. Not quite sure what I did as I'm not sure whether it was the battery side of things or the mem card, but here's what I'd been through and then it started working as some troubleshooting tips: I normalised the battery again (it's easier if you have a 2nd battery to boot PSP although you may get it to boot on AC) I re-partioned the Mem card as instructed in the guide which wiped it again Then installed the pan3xx folder as per the guide along with the 150, 340, 380 and 4.01<which is not mentioned in the guide but comes up as 'missing' when you load the installer off the card I ran the installer I pandorized the battery FIRST (backup and make a note of the the settings) I used DDCv4 (but this time left off Elf & NAND tool) I also went back into the MemStick and MS-IPL options and ran the install MSIPL command < which appeared to make a difference - but I don't know (try it with and without) (It may also be worth trying the battery pandorize at the end rather than the start of this list) Quit Battery Out Battery In White menu came up and we were away I'm sorry I can't be more specific, but it's late and I've tried 100 things to get this working, maybe I'll have another go once I get my new battery and let you know what was going wrong... suspect it may be one or more of the steps above that you need to do in addition to the guide... Best of luck! Mark Reply Taz July 8, 2009 at 5:45 pm Mark, you're an absolute genius! I had the same problem, followed your instructions and the pandora worked perfectly on the Slim.

Is PSP1001 the PSP-3000 or am I retarded? lol Just a bit confused on if a PSP-3000 has the 1001 on it, because mine does. Second, I couldn't get myself a 1G pro duo stick, so I've decided to use the one I already have. At first, I wanted to get a second stick for the MMS, but after looking around I found it difficult to find a decent price or the 1G version at all. At least on ebay. So I got a 2G. Thus, I now have the 1G. The problem is that I've already updated my PSP to 5.01 and when I click on the memory stick info on the PSP, it shows me the 5.01 update. So, if I want to make this stick a MMS, would I have to delete the upgrade from the stick manually or just delete it off my PSP? Reply Simon Slangen December 2, 2008 at 1:46 pm It's just an example as of where to find the serial number. Just make sure yours doesn't start with PSP-3 (e.g. PSP-3000 or PSP-3001). 1G or 2G doesn't really matter, but you should try to stay beneath 8G You won't be able to make a MMS with your PSP. You'll need to use another CFW PSP (one that is already cracked) or use one of the other methods (use Rainmaker's MMS maker and hardmod your battery or buy yourself a TOOL battery).

What did you use to make your Pandora Battery? Hardmod or TOOL battery? Hardmod You'll need another battery. TOOL If you can't boot with your original battery, try with your MMS removed. If that doesn't work, try to install the OFW 3.80 with your Pandora ( 0 in the menu ). Does that work? If it works, it won't be too hard to downgrade further using aprevious Pandora version.

Booting with your normal battery and without MMS does not work either? Let's try to install another version of Pandora (the original one). We'll use Rainman\\'s MMS Maker. 1) I suppose you already have Rainman's MMS Maker.

Option three means you'll have purchased a TOOL battery. Once you've got one, insert your memory stick and the battery. Your PSP will turn itself on by default. Just follow the on-screen instructions to install the 3.80 CFW. Once you've installed CFW 3.80 (using your TOOL battery and your MMS), you can follow the instructions in the 'Upgrade to the latest Custom Firmware' section to (guess what) upgrade to the latest custom firmware.

Afterwards you can access usb to make your MMS, use your TOOL and MMS to install the custom FW. rasmus July 13, 2009 at 8:41 am I have psp 1001 ver. 5.51, How can i upgrade it, pls help, thanks Reply Anupam December 1, 2008 at 9:43 am After creating mms what we have to do . No black and white screen is opening and what is 1.50 Kernel . please reply soon I am eager Reply Anupam December 1, 2008 at 9:33 am I have created the mms and transferred it to psp now not any screen has appeared and it is showing corrupted data in my game folder. Please reply soon........... Reply Anupam December 1, 2008 at 8:35 am I have a psp and i am using 3 method. You are saying that I have to download OFW 3.80 and 1.50. Where 1.50 is used and we have to download CFW 3.80 to upadate or not Reply sagar thapa November 30, 2008 at 8:26 am hi mate, Whats wrong .. when i tried to use pandora installer its says \"\"cannot be started DATA is CORRUPTED\"\" i tried 2 follow the steps but i thing i m still unclear i m stuck on pandora installer.. DESCRIPTION of my PSP is PSP 1000, The battery i m using is DATEL 3600m/ah (does it work in this battery), memory stick is SONY MEMORY STICK PRO DUO 2gb( MAGIC GATE) i dont get what is CFW PSP, i dont think i have tht and one more thing i had recently updated my PSP to 5.1 Version thts latest official version.......plizz help me out i really need ur instruction.. Reply Simon Slangen November 30, 2008 at 8:41 am CFW = Custom FirmWare, this is a PSP that is already cracked. To use option 1 you'll need one of these. Perhaps you can borrow one from a friend? If that is not the case, you'll have to go by option 2 or 3. Reply shiro November 29, 2008 at 1:30 am Yes, i have made the memory stick using the software above. i created DC 4 3.80 using the download links above too. i insert the mem stick and plug the pandora battery and i got a blank screen with power indicator green light on for ages.. i tried to hold the L button, i even taped the L button to stay pushed all night, i woke up this morning and still blank screen Reply Simon Slangen November 29, 2008 at 8:02 am Your battery seems fine, so the problem should be with your magic memory stick. Try making it again, either with the CFW PSP you used earlier (don't mod the battery again!) or by using these steps , also through a working PSP or using a MS adaptor. Reply Taz July 8, 2009 at 5:12 pm I had the same problem. I followed all instructions above, used a spare CFW PSP to make my pandora battery and magic stick. Everything seemed fine until I put the pandora into my Slim to downgrade.. just a green light and black screen. Only now my CFW PSP wont turn on to change anything back because the battery is padorafied.. Does this mean I have to buy another batery to get it back again, or is there something I can do? Thanks x Reply Jay Jay February 12, 2009 at 10:53 pm I have the same problem, green light, black screen for ages for my PSP 2001, Version 4.05. Have you figured out how to get it to work yet? Reply shieldsy94 November 28, 2008 at 12:16 pm HELP I have used the files described, got a datel battery, however when i install it it tells me to shut down, i have done this but it keeps coming up with the black screen asking to update, i dont have a clue HELP PLEASE. by the way my version was 5.01. Reply shiro November 28, 2008 at 6:54 am hi there.. i just want to say, that i tried the above on my PSP 2000 PB bought in japan. what happen is this: i plug the Pandora battery and it just turn the power indicator green for like ages.... is this mean i have the unhackable PSP?? or did i do something wrong??? coz you said as long as its 2000 it must be ok HELPPPPP added details: my psp comes with OFW 4.01 the box says: PSP-2000PB, 100V, G on the bottom of the PSP the code says PSP-2000 just as in the picture above. Reply Simon Slangen November 28, 2008 at 10:08 am There's nothing strange with that, don't worry. Normally the battery will now trigger the software on the magic memory stick. Make sure it's inserted, have you made one yet? Reply shiro November 29, 2008 at 1:25 am Yes, I have created the memory stick just as described using DC 4 and 3.80 like the guide said... but still.. black screen and green light indicator on for like ages... Help me please... Reply Simon Slangen December 2, 2008 at 10:13 am Try recreating your MMC as explained to Adam below. max December 15, 2008 at 11:39 am Simon I have the same problem that Shiro's having with my PSP... Remember I've asked you if it is possible that I might have a new mobo 088v3 that cannot be hacked... I have inserted a pandora from a phat and try 2 MMS and same problem, green led on forever and blackscreen.. I still have the warranty so I can't open my PSP to see what is written on the mobo.. SO unfortunately for us, the few unlucky owners of unhackable 2004 PSP is still hopeleft , #1: so that DARK ALEX will have time to crack the encription of this mobo, or #2: to sell the 2004 PSP and buy a brand new 3004 PSP after it can be hacked ( I think that 3004 will be hacked sooner that 2004 PSP w. 088v3 mobo) , or #3: to sell the 2004 PSP and buy a second hand PSP that is already modded.. That's it folks... Simon Slangen December 16, 2008 at 4:24 am Ok, additional research show that some types of the PSP 2004 can't be cracked, the ones with a TA88v3 motherboard. These come with Firmware 4.01 or 4.05 pre-installed . Your screen will remain black when trying to use a Pandora Battery. Mohamed December 31, 2008 at 3:01 pm I also have teh PSP 2004, I tried the pandora battery and magic stick and I also had the black screen, is it the same board as the 3000 ? Can this problem be fixed or should I also sell it and buy the 3000 ?!! Austin November 27, 2008 at 8:51 am for option 3 do i need to download firmware 3.80 or custom firmware 3.80 and if its custom firmware 3.80 doesnt that mean i have to already have a cfw Reply Simon Slangen November 27, 2008 at 11:32 am If there is no mention of CFW whatsoever, you can allways assume OFW. So... original firmware.

Austin November 27, 2008 at 8:38 am does it work with the 3.6v 1200 mah battery because it came stock with the psp 2001 star wars version Reply Greg November 27, 2008 at 5:29 am Hey Simon, thanks a whole freakin' lot!!! I never thought that I would be able to downgrade out of OFW 5.01. You're the greatest, I've been looking for sites all over to downgrade my PSP Slim and put it into CFW, and I finally found my solution here. WHOOOO!!!!! Thanks again Simon Reply dean December 7, 2008 at 4:58 am I can't find where it mentions the OFW version 5.01 , can i downgrade my psp (2002 model) just the same as you would a lower firmware version. Reply Buy Pandora Battery November 26, 2008 at 7:52 pm Wow - awesome guide man. I think this one is the best one I've come across. I see a lot of people who just struggle with this. I'll have to point them out to this in the future. Keep up the great posts. Reply max November 26, 2008 at 8:08 am Hi, what about the new PSP-2004 PB-G , can it be \"fixed\" ? OFW 5.01 ... how do I know if I have that new motherboard that can't be fixed yet? I don't have a pandora or any friend around that have one. Any suggestions? Any advices? THX Reply Simon Slangen November 26, 2008 at 8:47 am PSP-2004 PB-G ==> PSP 2000 motherboard. The only ones that can't be fixed (yet) are the PSP 3000's If you don't have a friend with a CFW psp, you'll have to use option 2 or 3 Reply max November 26, 2008 at 11:05 am Thx Simon, I'm asking 'cause when I google search for modding the psp, there were ppl who got brand new slim&lite with a TA-088 v3 motherboard on them , and the pandora, time machine and CD was not working.. the 2004 PB-G is quite a new psp slim and that was my concern.. thx again for your answer. btw , how can you tell wich m-board is on slim&lite psp's? on the phat it was written on the board and you could see the number under the umd door.. - later edit.. I forgot to mention, my psp OFW is 5.01 .. I have to downgrade to 5.00 in order to install 5.00M 33-4 ? THX Reply Simon Slangen January 4, 2009 at 8:08 am This has been said quite a few times in the comments, but perhaps it's best to say it at the top as well (I can't seriously expect people to read all 250+ comments) There are 2 types of the PSP that can't be cracked/hacked atm: - PSP-3000 and up - PSP-2004 with a TA88v3 motherboard. These are the ones that come pre-installed with FW version 4.01 or 4.05. I hope this solves some problems. Hoang November 24, 2008 at 5:13 pm thanks Simon- i got CFW psp from my friend, so i have to do all that step in the CFW psp right? then which step i ll do on my psp? please explain it to me a little bit more, i have no exp on this process, and i dont wanna mess up my psp and my friend's psp- thanks agian Reply shieldsy94 November 24, 2008 at 2:42 pm it says on the first step that the files are corrupt??? Reply Simon Slangen November 24, 2008 at 2:56 pm A bit more specific? If you mean the firmware files (eboot), download them again. Did you download them from the links we provided? Else, try a google search (e.g. eboot 1.50 download), there are lots of places where you can find these. If you are talking about the Pandora Installer you are trying to run on your PSP, are you sure you are using a CFW (already cracked) PSP? If so, try downloading the Pandora Installer files again, or upgrade your CFW firmware PSP to a newer CFW version. (please don't update it to a newer official firmware, I'm sure your friend or whoever owns that PSP will be pissed off) Reply jakeman December 18, 2008 at 7:11 pm my psp is 2001 and i cant downgrade it cause its 5.02 official firmware. i have been searching the internet forever help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Reply xar January 9, 2009 at 5:10 am I have a CFW Fat PSP and a Slim PSP with v5.02 Official firmware.

Reply haker 101 December 24, 2009 at 1:15 am if it doesnt work then you have a t8-v3 or the magic mem stick is a bad one try both and look at the battery area if the serial number starts with hu8 its not hackable and there is nothing you can do sorry haker 101 December 24, 2009 at 1:24 am 4got to mention that for a slim somtimes you have to hold a button b4 till after you have out in the pandora battery E.G. up arrow ,Triangle , R trigger, L trigger any of those Nura February 4, 2010 at 4:21 am Simon, This is a wonderful post, i have few quick questions, i have PSP 2001 with official firmware 6.0 and i don't have any friends who ows an CFW PSP, nor i have a spar battery, so i should follow Option 3 right?
