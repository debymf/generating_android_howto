As I've been helping few friends finding the best prices for their new laptops few questions came to my mind: - what's a laptop lifespan? - what's the difference in prices? - what machine is more suitable for this friend? I checked that normally a system survives for an average of 4-6 years and that prices for a modest user would be something about 200 to 450 dollars and 900+ for a entry level gaming laptop (yes, you can get one gaming laptop with 500). For students that are really short of money I would highly recommend just get a mini usb keyboard and use it with their phones (or maybe even buying a modest tablet) plus accessory to adjust the phone screen to a better view level. I could safely say that it would be enough for 90% of the people that need a extra computer or even don't have one. Nice post. Reply Jacob W. July 12, 2017 at 8:00 pm I think that USB keyboards that work with Windows computers and with Android phones are awesome. If you have a problem with certain keys (such as the SHIFT, ALT, and CONTROL key) when you have a USB keyboard plugged into your Android device (phone or tablet), like I did, you may be able to solve the problem by doing the following: *For the SHIFT, ALT, and CONTROL key problems, here is the USB Keyboard Shift, Alt, Control key solution/fix that I found: If you want your USB keyboard plugged into your Android device to be fully functional (and get the SHIFT key to work properly, allowing you to capitalize letters and type symbols such as the exclamation mark symbol !, the 'at' symbol @, pound/number symbol/hashtag symbol #, dollar sign symbol $, percent/percentage sign symbol %, carrot symbol ^, the 'and' symbol &, the asterisk/star symbol *, the question mark symbol ?, the colon symbol :, the quotation mark symbol \", etc... as well as get the ALT and CONTROL keys to work so you can do things such as CTRL-C, CTRL-X, CTRL-V, etc.):: *Make sure to download the \"GO Keyboard\" free app from the Google Play app store! When I first bought my USB keyboard and plugged it into my Android phone (a Samsung Galaxy S5), the keyboard worked, but not completely. The shift key and control key didn't work (when I held down the shift key and then pressed letter keys & number keys to capitalize letters & access symbols, it didn't capitalize or type symbols; when I tried to hold down CTRL or ALT and press another key, it didn't do the things that those keys normally do on desktop or laptop PC computers). I tried other keyboard apps (the Samsung keyboard app and Swiftkey Keyboard app), but they didn't allow the Shift key or ALT key to work properly when I plugged in the USB keyboard to my Android phone. After trying to get the keyboard settings to work on my phone (and trying various apps such as the Samsung keyboard/typing app and the Swift Key keyboard/typing app), I finally found that the GO Keyboard app allows everything (including the Control and Alt keys) to work on my USB keyboard when is hooked up to my Android phone. I was so happy that I purchased the \"GO Keyboard Pro\" app (which is the same exact app as the Go Keyboard free app, just without ads) in the Google Play store for 3 bucks, and it also works great! I have no problems with the shift key, control key, or alt key now! Problem solved! Issue fixed. The track pad on USB keyboards is really cool is really cool (it not only allows you to control the cursor on your PC desktop or laptop computer, but it ALSO allows you to have a mouse cursor on your Android phone or tablet! How awesome is that?), but a word of caution: If you are like me and accidentally rest the palm of your hand on the track pad (& accidentally brush your hand/palm against the trackpad, making the cursor move without you wanting to move it), don't worry! You can fix this 'hand touching the track pad' problem too! Just hold down the blue \"Fn\" function key, just to the right of the left-side \"Ctrl\" control key (located at the bottom left corner of the keyboard) and then click on the right-side \"Alt\" key (just to the right of the Space bar key at the bottom of the keyboard, which has a 'mouse/cancel sign on top of a mouse' blue symbol right above the \"Alt\" key letters). This will activate/deactivate the track pad, which is very useful. I have used this feature many times to turn on & turn off the track pad, depending on if I want to use it or not. USB keyboards like the one I purchased are perfect for those like me who want a portable keyboard for both their Android phone (or tablet) and their Windows/PC desktop or laptop computer. You can get an excellent, high quality, great product that is thin, lightweight, super portable, easy to put in your laptop bag or other carrying bag/case, easy to transport, made of good quality materials, lies flat on a desk/table/surface, is comfortable to type on, doesn't feel too small or cramped, types well, the keys type smoothly, the keys don't stick, is very durable and types quietly, doesn't beep or make noises, is quiet, and overall a has great price for the quality - you can get a lot of value for the price. I love my USB keyboard (that works with my Android phones and my Windows computer) a lot, but just know that USB keyboards can have quirks (e.g. the problem of shift, ctrl, & alt key not working properly on Android devices, which you can easily solve by downloading the Go Keyboard app for free; the problem of the track pad being easy to press accidentally, which you can easily solve by turning off the track pad).

I can literally connect just about ANY USB peripheral to my Lumia 950. It has a USB type-C connector, and finding a type-C male to type-A female adapter was cheap, even supporting 3.0 SuperSpeed. The phone also runs Windows 10, making it compatible with almost everything. Keyboard? Mouse? They just work, no fiddling. Thumb drive? Plug it in, go to File Explorer, and have a look around. Need more USB things connected? Any USB hub will work too. Why would you want to use all these peripherals with a phone? Well, Windows 10 has Continuum, which means the phone goes into \"Desktop Mode\" when it detects normal desktop PC peripherals, making it work very much like a traditional computer. Even the usual Windows keyboard shortcuts still work. So, yeah Windows phone FTW. Reply Nemacol August 11, 2016 at 2:52 pm But on the other hand, once you have a keyboard, thumb drive, or any other USB device connected, you are still left with a Windows Phone.

I can connect upto a 2TB hdd, a key board and mouse. I actually have a special adapter as well (male microUSB to 3 female USB ports and 1 male USB port). Remember some things that you want to connect require power above what the device can provide and thw device battery will drain fairly quick and the male USB port is useful because you can have it permanently on charge. Some items that I connect require the connection to a power source to work The other item that is handy to get is a similar to your normal thumb hdd, that is it has a male usb connection, but it has a male microUSB connection on the other side. You can get these that are the size of a cigarette butt. Samsung has truly made there devices able to connect to anything. Apple have very limited capacity for this type of connectivity or they make it difficult to do this. I am currently working on connecting my Casio digital piano to my tablet. I will try this in the next day or two and see if I can get my IPADs to do the same. My current laptop recently died (Needs reformating), but I looking at using my tablet instead. I connect everything to my TV screen anyway, so screen size doesn't matter. Samsung just need to have additional ports built in and I will be a happy camper.

Reply Ted Leonard March 7, 2013 at 4:14 am I connected an OTG device and a USB keyboard first to my Samsung Prevail and then to my sister's Samsung Galaxy S2. Neither would recognize the keyboard or work at all. Anyone have and idea why? Reply erez March 7, 2013 at 10:42 am One option could be due to the keyboard's voltage draw. Is it a completely regular, garden-variety keyboard? Or is it fancy/unique in any way? I would suggest trying with a different keyboard. I don't know if the Prevail supports OTG but I'm pretty sure the S2 does. Reply Tim March 28, 2013 at 5:30 am An obvious question would be whether you are using a genuine OTG cable. In a post on 28 November, Drew Butler suggested, \"The Galaxy Tab 2 has a proprietary usb connector so what you need to do it would be a usb male to female converter used in conjunction with the usb data cable that came along with your tablet.\" That is initially what I had thought also, but was unsuccessful. As soon as I got hold of a genuine OTG cable (ordered online for under $2.00) I could connect both the keyboard and the thumb drive to my Galaxy S II - although obviously not at the same time. Incidentally, hitting the back button did not get rid of the Swype keyboard, but I did find that if I rotated the phone the Swype keyboard would disappear and I could still type on the USB keyboard.

Having a OTG cable means going mobile, even tossing a small little wired keyboard, etc, into your travel bag and getting some serious typing done while OTG(on the go)... Reply Matjaz Mirt November 28, 2012 at 1:13 pm That's good one. Must try! Reply John Vale November 28, 2012 at 12:01 pm Works great on my Sony S tablet. Nice tip. Reply brawdon November 28, 2012 at 6:22 am First, why not try a bluetooth keyboard? Second, not a problem with windows 8 devices! windows phone 8 also supports most devices via usb otg! Reply Erez Zukerman November 28, 2012 at 1:23 pm Bluetooth keyboards are more expensive, basically. That's the only reason I think. Reply Jorge Yort Rosal November 28, 2012 at 12:11 am Nice info. I better have one of those connectors. Can anyone help me where I can find those? thank you. Reply Erez Zukerman November 28, 2012 at 1:23 pm Ebay or Amazon (I've linked to it in the post). Reply Achraf Almouloudi November 27, 2012 at 11:33 pm I think OTG does not work on too many phones, actually only a very limited set in which Samsung Galaxy s2 is the king. Do anyone with the cheaper/lower end Android devices got it working . Reply Anonymous November 28, 2012 at 5:46 pm For this to work it requires ICS or newer. that is pretty much the only hitch. Reply Achraf Almouloudi November 28, 2012 at 6:44 pm No. I have seen it working on Samsung galaxy s2 with Gingerbread even before ICS came . Reply Drew Butler December 1, 2012 at 5:50 am To elaborate. My comment was wrong to a degree, Android has supported standard HID devices since froyo but to an extremely limited capacity. Only a handful of devices will work with keyboards or mice without having ICS and my comment was an attempt to steer people away from spending money on something that wouldn't work for them right out of the box. ICS brings the capability to use all sorts of peripherals and plug and play use for keyboards, mice, and game controllers on all devices running 4.0+ A lot can be done too mod anything, I modded my last Moto Photon 4g so that I could dual boot Ubuntu or an unofficial version of Jellybean. When you used that with a usb hub and an hdmi cable I always had a pc with 1 terra of storage wherever I went...My backup Photon is completely Gingerbread and will not run a KB or mouse via USB but will using Bluetooth Anyways... I have pretty much gotten out of the scene, too busy working and that phone was submerged in a 5 gallon bucket of water by my 3 y/o son(\"It was dirty daddy!!\").LOL Anyways.. not trying to argue with you or rant on and on.. just sharing some of my experiences. Again I want to encourage anyone interested in android development or that just has questions about their specific device to checkout http://www.xdadevelopers.com . It's been an extremely long day, everyone have a great night. Achraf Almouloudi December 1, 2012 at 2:42 pm So if you could get an unofficial ICS or Jelly bean on any of those normally-not-supporting devices, they will start supporting OTG feature ? what about their hardware USB charging port, does all of them provide output voltage and current to power the connected device up ? please clarify . Drew Butler December 1, 2012 at 5:52 am stock Gingerbread* 2.3.5 Achraf Almouloudi December 1, 2012 at 2:42 pm What does this comment mean ? lol . Drew Butler December 1, 2012 at 5:30 pm 1. The above comment was a correction to my previous comment.(it just means my Motorola Photon 4g is the stock version of android that my phone came with which is Gingerbread version 2.3.5) 2. I first want to warn anyone without extensive knowledge to read about the processes of rooting and installing a custom ROM onto your specific device before attempting it. THIS WILL VOID YOUR WARRANTY and if done incorrectly can \"Brick\" the device(turn it into an expensive paperweight LOL). This is partly why I didn't bring this all up earlier. I don't want to be responsible for someone messing up their phone. If you are still interested you will need to go to the site mentioned above and search for your device and see what is available in terms of custom ROMS & Kernels for the device in question, pretty much any question that you can think of will be answered in the forums. I am here to help if you or someone else is stuck on a specific part of the process but I do have a busy schedule so you will need to do the research. 3. To power most devices besides keyboards, mice or game controllers you will need to connect the devices to a powered usb hub and then connect the hub to the phone. Basically even though/if the phone/tablet can communicate with the device it cannot power them. I hope this comes across correctly. While I am here to help people must be willing to take time to learn. I do not know everything but am pretty good at figuring things out. I just use past experiences, deductive reasoning & google and youtube to fill in the gaps LOL hope I don't sound like a jerk :D. As I offered earlier if anyone needs help shoot me an email at drewbutler44 at gmail.com In order to help I need details for example: Device make and model and OS version. I can help with PC issues as well as Android issues just please be patient because I have a pretty hectic schedule. Have a great day Anonymous November 27, 2012 at 10:03 pm It would be good to try it with a phone as you did. With many Android Tablets, OTG Cable is almost standard and yes, most of them support both the keyboard and USB Drives. A few support hard disks also when the tablet is connected to the AC mains power. A few Tablets come with a regular USB port and the connection becomes straightforward... Reply Julian Altshul November 27, 2012 at 9:18 pm Why not use a bluetooth keyboard for this? Reply Erez Zukerman November 28, 2012 at 1:23 pm 1) Price: The cable costs $1, and many people already have a regular keyboard lying around somewhere. 2) Battery (although that's not such a sure shot, depends on the keyboards really). Reply Julian Altshul November 28, 2012 at 2:21 pm Fair points! Reply Shmuel Mendelsohn November 28, 2012 at 8:51 pm It's not just tablet + keyboard; it's smart phone + keyboard which = doubly awesome! Reply David December 13, 2014 at 8:24 pm I know this is old but I am going to reply. On my Samsung Galaxy Pro 12.2, my blue tooth keyboard will sometimes lag, bring up language select, type 7 copies of a letter, lose connection with my tablet, and I type 85 wpm with about 90-95 percent accuracy. Blue tooth keyboards for REAL uses suck. Same with my blue tooth mouse. This could be due to crapy Samsung drivers, don't care. Want a physically connected keyboard so I won't have these problems. Sick and tired of dealing with and correcting typing errors I didn't cause when taking notes in fast paced college classes. Reply Austen Gause November 27, 2012 at 8:43 pm that is the coolest thing ever TABLET + KEYBOARD = AWESOME Reply Nohl Lyons November 27, 2012 at 8:37 pm This is awesome! What phones has people tried? Reply juan david gil November 27, 2012 at 7:44 pm \"As you may recall, I use an alternative (read: better) keyboard layout called Colemak\" thank you sir that made my day. colemak users unite!
