Got a response, Tina - or an update? Reply Peter May 11, 2015 at 10:42 am Interesting post. However, does OneDrive recvognise my Lumia settings for the camera roll to be stored on an SD card rather than the main phone memory? I don't seem to be getting any synchronisation after setting up OneDrive on PC and Lumia. Reply E. Bush April 27, 2015 at 5:39 am Does either Office 365 Personal or Office 365 Business monitor folders or libraries automatically that are not specifically moved to the OneDrive library. I know in Windows 8.1 that camera photos are monitored and automatically uploaded. Some ads insinuate that anything added to My Documents are monitored and uploaded. I switched from DropBox to OneDrive so I could decide which files are available offline. Did I lose the ability to say which folders/files are included? Reply Tina April 27, 2015 at 11:38 am Only folders inside your OneDrive folder are synced to your online OneDrive library. You can sync additional folders using symbolic links. Reply Evan April 26, 2015 at 10:17 pm Tina, is there anyway to pause / start the sync of my OneDrive? Reply Anonymous August 4, 2015 at 3:54 pm Hi Evan, here's a link to an article explaining how you can pause / start the OneDrive Sync: [Broken Link Removed] Reply becca April 6, 2015 at 3:31 am hello. thanks everyone for the information. I have a new wind8.1 computer and decided to take advantage of the 1TB of storage on onedrive and so moved all my photos and videos to onedrive. though it seems it can't upload files which are too big. i realised we don't have enough data on our internet plan to upload them all anyway, so i want to stop this sync. There are over 2 thousand files (photos and videos) which are still showing in the uploads folder (where it lists Actions in Progress), but it doesn't seem to give me any options to resume or remove them from syncing, or delete, or any other options for that matter. it just states \"uploading - 0% complete\". i would like to discontinue the upload. thanks in advance if anyone can help. Reply Tina April 6, 2015 at 7:14 pm Becca, in Windows 8.1 you can disable OneDrive sync. This page describes it very well: How to Completely Disable OneDrive Reply Patricia April 1, 2015 at 7:32 pm Thank you for the article. I learned more today than many trips to ask questions. :) Can you please tell me how to set sync on a timer so it only happens between midnight and 4 am? I am using a new internet provider and have a limit on data. free time is that window. THANKS Reply Tina April 2, 2015 at 9:35 am Glad you found this article useful, Patricia. AFAIK, OneDrive currently doesn't offer a timed sync feature. However, OneDrive will only sync, when the app is running. I would suggest to not run the app, unless you want it to sync. Go into OneDrive settings (right-click icon in notifications area / system tray), in the Settings tab remove the checkmark for \"Start OneDrive automatically when I sign in to Windows\". That way, OneDrive won't be able to sync, unless you start the app. Then use Windows Task Scheduler to set up a scheduled task to launch OneDrive at midnight every day. Your computer needs to be turned on for this to work. Alternatively, you could schedule your computer to boot just before OneDrive is supposed to run.

I don't see pieces like this very often. Bravo Reply Tina April 2, 2015 at 9:35 am Thank you for the praise, Ed! Reply Gareth March 6, 2015 at 9:29 am There is option to pause sync available in the notification area at the bottom of the screen, clicking the OneDrive icon. Is that any help? Reply Tim February 6, 2015 at 3:09 am Windows 8.1 is the worst thing to happen to computing since Vista. Clunky, badly laid out, slow and user hostile. An absolute disaster. OneDrive has slowed my computer down to the point that it's embarrassing to be with clients. With Windows 7 and SkyDrive everything worked brilliantly - so why go and wreck it? Is there anyway that I can sync at the end of a session instead of waiting 5 - 10 minutes for files to sync the whole time? Thanks Reply david January 30, 2015 at 10:02 am the most annoying thing about one drive is that i can't go through and delete the photos that i don't want, without them automatically re-syncing from my phone. so any bad pictures i take, which is the majority of them, i have to delete twice Reply Octo Podi July 19, 2017 at 2:38 am Yep, in July '17 that still seems to be the case. :( Reply Roman January 28, 2015 at 3:07 pm I would rather see an option so that I can save the files locally first, and then sync them to the cloud second. That way I everything would be local for quick access (like we are all used to prior to the cloud). And if I could do this, we would need this enormously giant officefilecache folder that apparently holds a second copy (among other things) of the files that I already have on my computer. To be clear: I don't really want to work from the cloud; I just want to use the cloud as my backup. Reply jess November 14, 2014 at 7:29 pm How do u remove photos that I deleted and put in the recycle bin?? I can still see them in the recycle bin Reply Tina November 15, 2014 at 1:38 pm Have you tried to empty the recycle bin? Reply Anders September 10, 2014 at 7:45 pm After disabling standard OneDrive app I use an alternative client called SyncDriver from here syncdriver.com Reply michel October 7, 2014 at 3:49 pm Could you tell us how this is better? I went to the webpage, but I don't see any advantage. Reply Anders October 13, 2014 at 1:10 pm No need for use the same account you logged in to Windows 8.1. It is quite critical for me. Reply JohnB August 24, 2014 at 1:12 pm Of all my systems OneDrive works best on an old Windows 7 system. Under Windows 8.1 OneDrive reloads at least once a day. Further, the assumption by Microsoft that I want all cloud folders visible on a local system is flawed - under Windows 7 I make the decision which folders are visible locally - I have archive folders that I don't want visible locally and that are relatively large that I don't want to allocate space locally (even if they are only \"smart folders\" they do take up space) - let me manage my systems! Reply antman May 27, 2014 at 12:28 am Thank you sexy. These are some great pointers. Like someone else said, I wish to use Onedrive modern app without linking my MS account to Windows 8. Microsoft needs to change this behavior. Reply Dale May 26, 2014 at 1:27 pm My biggest gripe with OneDrive is the requirement to be logged in to a specific account on my 8.1 laptop, in order to access OneDrive. If there is a way to use OneDrive like other cloud storage systems, via login credential on a webpage, I'd be eager to hear about that. Reply Ian May 23, 2014 at 11:56 pm Some great tips and info here but one point I want to question, Have you actually tried to delete the original folder location? even with admin rights will full permission? I tried then ran the net user command prompt and tried again and failed, as you later commented that the drive was an integral part of the O/S you failed to comprehend that admin rights over any file is a variable the UAC controls the level of of privilege that is not continuous, disabling the prompts won't help either. Small point. live with the security and ignore the folder! Reply Tina S May 24, 2014 at 9:38 am Thank you for your comment, Ian. I did delete the original folder after moving OneDrive to its new location as described above. I just checked again and the OneDrive folder is no longer there. This was on Windows 8.1 with the most recent updates installed and OneDrive moved to a second partition.
