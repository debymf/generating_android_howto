You also get notification mirroring AND mirroring your phone. At least in Airdroid. Reply Micki April 20, 2019 at 11:22 am I use Sendanywhere sometimes and it works good. Reply Thamizh June 28, 2013 at 1:40 am How to send a sensed data to a PC from android mobile..? Reply Grr March 10, 2013 at 12:44 pm I have been using AirDroid, and it works just good. However, when the permanent pin is set, it still doesn't accepts it. Going to try PushBullet as well. Looks useful Reply Tomas February 27, 2013 at 2:42 pm I use softwaredatacable, a great product. Reply Kelly Buchanan February 15, 2013 at 1:10 am My Sync Center works quite well. [Broken Link Removed] Reply David Omon February 13, 2013 at 11:29 am My Favorite is AirDroid, Love it... especially version 2 ( http://v2.airdroid.com ) which has the capability of tracking the phone, and supports 3G / 4G Reply David E February 13, 2013 at 12:50 am I tried Airdroid but I got bored with scanning the QR code. I tried Cheetahsync and it's good. (surprised it was not mentioned).The free version supports one-way sync and one sync relationship. Now I am using ftp, but the opposite way from what you describe. I am using FolderSync as a client and my PC as a server (using FileZilla server). That way I can just tap the FolderSync widget and pull down all the new files. FolderSync is mainly touted for sync with Dropbox et al (its icon is a cloud). The free version supports two-way sync and is pretty full featured, You have to get the paid version to get multiple account support, file filters and a few other features.

Loved Airdroid. but just one addition, In case someone owns a Samsung Device (I got a SGS2), an app called Kies Air does the same as Airdroid but, better! Airdroid still is developing and does stuff a bit slower when i compared to Kies Air! Reply Anonymous February 12, 2013 at 5:54 pm I use a cable to transfer data. Reply Daniel Escasa February 13, 2013 at 11:07 am I'd also use a cable, except that I lose all access to my SD card from the phone when I'm connected. Android then has to re-scan my SD card once I've disconnected. Reply Shardul Seth February 9, 2013 at 6:14 pm Check out MyPhoneExplorer.. It can connect via USB and Wifi, and tons if features. Reply CGA February 10, 2013 at 10:03 am Couldn't agree more, gets way too little attention. Also gives you the ability to remote control your phone (think remote desktop). Reply Daniel Escasa February 13, 2013 at 11:03 am Unfortunately, it requires a desktop client, which judging from the file to be downloaded is Windows-only. Does look more feature-rich than the other software mentioned here though. Reply android underground February 9, 2013 at 2:20 pm Pingponging files through the cloud is nice and easy, but all cloud services want you to install their own app that connects to one cloud account on one cloud service only. If you don't want a homescreen full of apps for all your cloud services just use a file manager to fit 'em all in one app. My current favourite is ES FileExplorer, which talks with all my dropbox/skydrive/box.net/sugarsync/gdrive accounts. It has an ftp client and server too, and it dances samba. Reply samol February 9, 2013 at 2:00 pm One more way is to use ES File Explorer in Android to download files from a \"Windows Shared Folder'. Check out Chris Hoffman's article about ES File Explorer dated Jan 9, 2013. For some reason I can't paste the link. Here's how I just did a transfer. -open ES. -in top left hand corner select Local then Lan -select the NEW+ button then Scan (you can click the screen to stop it once your network data appears) -select your network/windows shared folder -find the file you want t transfer and select copy -in top left corner again select lan/local select the folder you want to copy to, then select paste. You should see the a copy icon at the bottom of the page. Click on the icon to see the file being copied. You can see the download progress in the Android taskbar. This also works with my wdtv box to download a movie or whatever. Of course you can just stream the movie to watch it anyway. Reply Ryan Dube February 9, 2013 at 10:07 pm Awesome - thanks for the great tip Samol. ES File Explorer is a great solution as well, I agree. Reply arkhadius February 9, 2013 at 11:14 am I used to use dropbox but it was laggy. Then I started using TeamVIewer for transfering files between devices, you forgot about this one :) But that Wi-Fi explorer seems nice, I'll check it. Thanks :) Reply Slashee the Cow February 9, 2013 at 1:30 am In the first screenshot, you say to tap on the \"USB debugging connected\" notification - that's wrong, tapping that will just take you to the debugging options, which most people who aren't developers won't be interested in - and won't have on in the first place, so that notification won't appear for most people. It is possible to transfer files over a debugging connection, but only by pushing them through adb, which requires the Android SDK. You just want to tap on the notification that says \"USB connected\" (which might be different depending on the ROM). Also, not all phones (or to be more specific, ROMs) will mount as a USB mass storage device, some (from memory I think it's at least Samsung devices running TouchWiz) will only mount as an MTP device - you should still be able to transfer files using Windows Explorer though. Reply Ryan Dube February 9, 2013 at 1:35 am That's a really good point - on my phone (my ROM) it allows a toggle between debugging and mass storage, but you make an excellent point that making the mount as USB can be different by ROM (or nonexistent for some), so that is important to keep in mind. Thank you for the clarification. Reply Stephen Mitchell February 8, 2013 at 10:23 pm Any idea how to get a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 to appear as USB Mass Storage? I have USB debugging enabled, but the phone still only gives the options of connecting via MTP or PTP. Reply Ryan Dube February 8, 2013 at 10:45 pm Have you tried toggling USB debugging while it's connected to the PC to see what it does? At some point the computer should pick up on the device as a connected USB storage device. If you still have issues, you might try asking about in the Answers section of this site to see if anyone else with a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 has done this. Reply Stephen Mitchell February 9, 2013 at 9:29 pm I've tried toggling USB debugging with the phone connected. I see a dialogue asking me whether to turn on debugging, but nothing else happens. As per Slashee the Cow's comment below, I think that my phone simply doesn't support USB Mass Storage mode. It will connect as an MTP device, but as I'm using Debian which doesn't support MTP very well this isn't especially useful. On a more positive note, I've set up an FTP server by following your instructions. This isn't ideal since I don't know of any media players that sync over FTP, but at least it gives me a reliable way to move files to and from my phone by hand which I haven't been able to do since I switched from Windows to Debian several weeks ago. Reply Ryan Dube February 9, 2013 at 10:08 pm Awesome - glad to hear the FTP server solution worked. I actually use the FTP solution often mostly because I've always liked using FTP commands, not so much out of convenience. Glad you found a solution that worked for you. Anonymous February 12, 2013 at 7:27 pm Supposedly, USB Mass Storage goes away with Jelly Bean, if not already with ICS. This is a major bummer as I used robocopy to mass transfer and verify stuff from the phone to the PC. Reply David E February 13, 2013 at 12:54 am Mass Storage is still there in Jellybean, at least in CyanogenMod, it's just off by default. Reply Greg February 12, 2013 at 10:29 pm I had some issues until I used the stock cable that came with my phone, rather than a Motorola cable I had laying around by my computer. I thought I had USB debugging turned on, but it's off now and I just transferred files recently (sorry, not near a computer to test this). But I can definitely confirm that my stock cable with stock note 2 came up as a mas storage device. Try AirDroid if you haven't though, extremely easy and feature rich. Reply Max February 8, 2013 at 6:34 pm Airdroid looks awesome Reply Ryan Dube February 8, 2013 at 10:43 pm Thanks - it really is. One of the editors here told me my cyanogenmod interface looks \"outdated\". I think it looks cool. :-) Thanks for your comment. Reply Mike February 8, 2013 at 6:04 pm I use a lot Samba Filesharing over wifi.. it is an excellent tool too. Reply Ryan Dube February 8, 2013 at 10:42 pm I've used Samba only once at work for another device on the network. It seemed a bit awkward to me, but I think it's just because I'm not used to the different filesharing setup. I've always wanted to try it in this scenario though. Reply TorchingIgloosdotcom February 9, 2013 at 12:33 am I agree, I use this almost daily. If you're rooted and using Wi-FI it's simple to setup, and a MUST HAVE! No cords FTW! If you have problems accessing the device using it's network name, try using \\\\ip in windows explorer instead, works like a charm every time (example: \\\\192.168.0.105) Reply", "url": "https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-ways-to-get-data-from-your-desktop-to-your-android/", "index": 1}
