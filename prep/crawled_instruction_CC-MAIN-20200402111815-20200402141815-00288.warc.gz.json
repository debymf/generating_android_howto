If you're using an Android device, the odds are good you're already signed into your Gmail account. When you select the Google account, the Outlook app will request permission to access it. You'll see another screen with your email accounts. Select your Gmail account from the list. Again, confirm permissions for the Outlook app to access your Gmail account. When you've finished, you'll see your Gmail account emails in the Gmail inbox inside the Outlook mobile app. If you ever want to add more Gmail accounts to your Outlook mobile app, tap the menu icon and select the gear settings icon. In the Settings screen, you can tap Add Account to add another Gmail account (or any other external email account that supports POP access). Then repeat the same process as when you set up the first Gmail account.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/access-gmail-outlook-pop-1173639", "index": 0}
