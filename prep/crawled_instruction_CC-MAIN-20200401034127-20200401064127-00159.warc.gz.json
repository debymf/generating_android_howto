Search for official Tor Browser and install the app. The official version has a purple onion logo. (The Alpha test version has a green onion logo you want the purple stable version.) When the app opens, hit Connect . The connecting process can take a minute or longer, depending on your network connection. After connecting, it s a good idea to run a test. There are two simple ways to test if your connection is routing through the Tor network. Type what is my ip in the Tor Browser search bar. DuckDuckGo will display the IP address the search request originated from. You can tap one of the links to find out exactly where your data appears to come from. Head to the Hidden Wiki. The Hidden Wiki is a directory of sorts for the dark web. It s an onion site, meaning that unless you have the correct browser configuration, you won t be able access it. You are now using the official Android Tor Browser correctly.", "url": "https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/guide-tor-android/", "index": 0}
