If it is, IT might be able to resolve it for you. Be prepared for a possible no when you ask your school or work IT to fix a security issue. It might be set that way for a reason. If you installed a work-related application yourself, use the following path in Android 9 to uninstall it: Settings > Apps & notifications > See all apps > [selected app] > Uninstall . In Android 8 and 7, use Settings > Apps > [selected app] > Uninstall . If you re using Chrome Incognito Mode, you ll need to disable it before you can take a screenshot. To do so: In the upper-right corner of Chrome, tap the Tabs icon, which will be a number representing the number of tabs you have open. Tap the X in the upper-right corner of each Incognito tab to close them. Open a new tab in regular mode, and take your screenshot from there. If none of the above issues is the problem, try an alternate method for capturing a screenshot. The primary methods are (1) pressing a combination of keys on the device, (2) using the swipe function, or (3) using Google Assistant . The standard key combination is pressing the Volume Down and Power buttons at the same time. However, depending on your device model, it might be that you press the Home and Power buttons at the same time ( Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel devices use this method). If you have a Samsung Galaxy device, you can use a hand gesture to capture a screenshot. To enable this feature, go to Settings > Advanced features . Scroll down to Palm swipe to capture , and enable this setting. Once you have the feature enabled, hold your right hand straight out as though you re going to shake someone s hand. Place the outside of your hand straight up and down on the right side of the screen, then slide it over to the left side (you can also use your left hand and go left to right). To use Google Assistant (GA) to capture a screenshot, start with the image you want to capture up on your screen. Say, OK, Google, take a screenshot. GA will respond, OK, touch to continue.\" It will show a smaller version of the screen image, and options for sending it (e.g. text, email, social media, photo storage) will pop up. Choose the method you want to use for sending the image. To address messages like, Couldn t save screenshot. Storage may be in use, or, Can t take screenshot due to limited storage space, try rebooting your device. To do this, simply power it down as you normally would, then turn it back on. If that method doesn t work, you can clear your cache. In Android 9 and 8, it s a little trickier than in Android 7. From the Play Store, install the Files by Google app, and open it. At the bottom of the screen tap Browse . On the next screen tap Apps . In the upper-right corner tap the three-dot icon, and choose Select all . Tap the three dots again and select Delete junk files . In Android 7, you won t need Files by Google . Instead, go to Settings > Device Maintenance > Storage > Clean Now . This action frees up storage space by deleting unnecessary data, such as residual data and advertisement files in addition to cached data. As a last resort, you can try a factory reset on your phone. Before taking this step, know that it will erase all your data. Be sure to back up contacts, images, videos, files, and other items you want to keep. The process for a factory reset varies depending on device. If the following steps don t work, do a search within your settings for factory reset. In Android 9, go to Settings > System > Advanced > Reset options . Tap Erase all data (factory reset) , then tap Reset phone . You may be asked to confirm your security settings. Then tap Erase everything . In Android 8 or 7, go to Settings > About device (or General Management ) > Reset > Factory data reset . Follow on-screen instructions to complete the process. Hopefully one of these tips has helped you get your screenshot feature working again. If not, it might be time to take your device to a professional.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/android-screenshot-not-working-fixes-4586908", "index": 0}
