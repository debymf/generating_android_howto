You can also start typing someone's name into the text field. The iPad will list out matching contacts below the input box. You may only need to type the first few letters of a name to find the contact.

FaceTime will initiate the call, and the person or people on the other side will receive alerts that you're contacting them.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/use-facetime-on-ipad-1994503", "index": 0}
