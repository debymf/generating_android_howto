Besides, you seem to be missing the most basic point. Arron Walker August 20, 2012 at 12:18 am I see the point, but I'd refused to acknowledge it, I'd rather not get into an argument over it, and I thought I saw something you had not realised.

Reply Noman Fayez August 13, 2012 at 6:41 pm Does all your giveaway have ssame giveaway rules...........and global giveaway? Reply Jaroslaw Jasinski August 13, 2012 at 6:40 pm I am a student (like my e-mail suggests) the second year of Computer Science and I would like to volunteer and participate in the competition for this wonderful device, which is this drive. This disc would be a fantastic option for me, what I would like to include in your new laptop. For me, this drive would be a fantastic solution due to the fact that I would not have to worry that I could lose their data, through damage to the laptop, another reason she could be the speed of system startup. I was very pleased by my system as urchomi? be as fast as he could. Also, I could very quickly compile your programs. So I think this drive was saved by me through the whole period of study. Therefore, I appeal to much to ask to you to convince you my comments to myself and that I could be the winner. But of course there are many people who have the same hope. So I wish you all good luck. Best Regards Jarek.

That would be excellent. Reply Truefire_ August 13, 2012 at 7:06 pm It doesn't extend it by much, but you do get more use out of it before it dies, since it's so much faster. It's like having a tablet almost. Nearly instant-on and app start.

Reply Heather August 13, 2012 at 5:09 pm May I ask why every time I enter one of these contests I get a \"The giveaway code you entered was incorrect\" message? My entry always goes through (I get the confirmation email) but it's annoying to have to check every single time. Reply Petey Pabler August 14, 2012 at 3:26 pm Are you entering the code on FB, or this page, or which way? This might help the communtiy that is trying to help you. Reply Heather August 14, 2012 at 3:42 pm I enter giveaway codes on the giveaway pages on this site. This has been a recurring issue for the past several months. Reply Richard McGill August 14, 2012 at 4:36 pm Heather, Are you cutting and pasting correctly? Make sure you don't include the full stop. I found that worked. Good luck. Thom Davies August 14, 2012 at 6:48 pm I have had the same issue, I just figure the site is goofy so I ignore the error message. Reply Vipul Jain August 13, 2012 at 4:50 pm w00000t!! I really want to win the Nexus 7, but what the hell, this is equally kick-ass :p Reply Basam August 14, 2012 at 10:49 pm Dude!

But i have less use of an extra Hdd right now than a tab. In my MBA, i need a device to swipe through my presentations & my phone just doesnt suffice & that tab isnt available in India :/ Reply Dany Bouffard August 13, 2012 at 4:48 pm When I click on the giveaway code on de facebook page of makeuseof the giveaway code for the Samsung 830 SSD (512 GB) is not in th elist of giveaway codes.
