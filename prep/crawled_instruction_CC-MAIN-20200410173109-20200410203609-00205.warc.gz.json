I have an HTC one and it keeps going into the hboot mode whenever I switch my phone on. I can t select anything in the menu there. So I start up my phone by pressing the power button and volume up button. (to add to my problems the volume down button isn t working) Any advice would be appreciated ::) Reply Martin D on October 8, 2014 Philip I believe your phone volume down button is struct or pressed inside. So when you use power button, it means you are actually pressing power + volume down button. Thats why you get hboot mode. You need to fix your hardware first or pull out the volume down button. Trust this helps Reply Rexzilla on September 21, 2017 Hi, I totally pulled my volume button out of the phone but it is still booting up in safe mode. Reply megan on September 21, 2017 Hi!

It s more likely to be the stuck volume key/rocker have them check to see if it s dirty/gummed-up and stuck in one position and see if that helps. Please let me know what happens.

My volume buttons stuck.what can i do ?? Reply Judy on July 31, 2016 Hi Adam, Have you tried the other methods? =-) Reply ChoonChang on August 9, 2016 Hi.. I m using Samsung S7 edge.. Now my volume down button stuck.. And cannot disable the safe mode. Currently I cannot get my phone fix but I need some downloaded app Is there any ways to by pass the safe mode and using the app ? Or can I disable my safe mode with the volume button stuck ? As I failed to un-stuck then volume button. Reply Judy on August 9, 2016 Hi There, Have you tried rebooting your phone or maybe even uninstalling the apps you may have recently installed. Maybe an app you have made your phone go into safe mode and uninstalling the ones you recently installed may help you phone boot normally. Hope this helps. =-) Reply ChoonChang on August 10, 2016 Yes.. Reboot to disable the safe mode. But due to volume button stuck So it back to safe mode (I guess) Was suggest by the service centre to change the whole screen & casing Tried delete the recent install app, but still the same Reply Judy on August 10, 2016 Hi There, It looks like the best thing you can do is get the stuck button fixed then. Hope there is a place nearby you can go to. =-) Thanks for commenting. Reply ChoonChang on August 13, 2016 Hi, thank for the info. i have schedule for the repair next week, due to working in outstation. Just found out that, some apps are actually can be use even in safe mode, e.g YouTube & FaceBook. Is there any ways to open the apps that previously installed ? Thanks Judy on August 20, 2016 Hi There, If you create a shortcut of that particular app that you want to launch in safe mode, you can do so while in safe mode. But you should be in normal mode when creating the shortcut. To run your app in safe mode, you need to copy your app to /system/app, for which you need root access. So only on a rooted device, it is possible. Thanks for commenting. =-) Christine on September 13, 2016 Hi, my friend is freaking out over this safe mode. Neither of us were aware of a safe mode at all. I want to know if it can delete apps without asking, because after safe mode had been turned on all/most of her downloaded apps were deleted. I want to know if safe mode did this or if something else did, and if it was safe mode, none of the things seem to be working and none of her buttons are stuck. She doesn t even have a case. I m asking because she is very concerned right now, thanks! Reply Judy on September 14, 2016 Hi Christine, Safe Mode doesn t delete apps or at least it shouldn t. The apps should be there once you get out of safe mode. Are you haveing trouble getting out? Reply Jesse on September 17, 2016 ZTE lever stuck in safe mode has water damage. Volume buttons do not work anymore either, still make calls, get calls, make text an receive text, but no apps can be used. I can use the internet, an YouTube beyond that no apps I downloaded will work. I have tried all of these steps. Please help Reply Judy on September 17, 2016 If the buttons are stuck, then I would recommend taking it in for service since the stuck buttons won t let you get out of safe mode. Reply sarp on September 18, 2016 I m using At&t Kyocera c6745 ,and there is a password on it I have try several time to do factory reset but I cant .really need your help Reply Judy on September 18, 2016 What exactly is preventing you from doing a factory reset? I mean, is it because the buttons are stuck, your phone freezes, Etc. Reply Pat Ander on November 12, 2016 You saved my sanity. The problem was my new case which pushed on the volume buttons too much (and didn t allow me to adjust the volume). I cut out the part of the case that was touching the volume buttons and voila!!! Thank you so much. I thought I was losing my mind. Reply Trevor on November 12, 2016 You re welcome. Cases are good for protecting the phone, but they can bring on a whole new set of problems. Reply Vanina on November 13, 2016 Hi Guys, I have the S7 edge and even though i reserted and turned off and on like 20 times safe mode is still on. I can t remove battery and i want to avoid a factory reset for now. Any ideas? Reply Trevor on November 13, 2016 Have you tried Method 4? This is likely how you entered Safe Mode and sometimes yo may need to manually tell it to leave Safe Mode. Reply Vanina on November 13, 2016 Thank you for the quick response! Unfortunately it didn t work :/ Reply Trevor on November 13, 2016 Why did you put it in Safe Mode, Was there something malfunctioning? You could try clearing the device cache to see if that helps. Everything I ve seen shows you should just need to power it down, then turn it on again. Example T-Mobile Support Site Reply Vanina on November 13, 2016 My phone required a system update and when it was done the safe mode was on. I cannot clear the cache because the aps aren t even there. All apps i see are like contacts, camera, gallery, calendar . nothing like facebook, instagram, whatsapp . Trevor on November 14, 2016 to me, it sounds like a corrupt download and update. there are apps and software out there that say they fix bad installs, but I can t vouch for any of them. You can try to redownload the update via the system update option in the settings. If that doesn t work, and as little fun as it is, it may be best to reset the phone. Tyler on November 18, 2016 Hey I hope people are still active here as I ve been having a strange problem. My phone has been stuck in safe mode the past week because my volume down button is stuck internally I ve factory reset twice now and is still broken. I want to use my apps, please help! Reply Trevor on November 18, 2016 If you have a mechanical issue (broken button), you will need to get that fixed. If a master reset didn t work, it s not a glitch or software problem. Reply kamal khurana on December 16, 2016 I m Facing Problem with few app which is installed in my Samsung galaxy A7 2016, When I Start wifi Internet in my phone , Lots of whtsapp msg, LinkedIn Msgs and Instagram Msgs Cumming and my Phone Screen Goes Black automatic for 2-3 seconds, this happen only with wifi internet not with data internet. Reply Trevor on December 16, 2016 most likely it s just trying to do too much all at once. If you set the less important apps to sync manually, you can probably avoid this issue. Try turning off the sync option for a few of the apps to see if the problem goes away. You can also free up some space on your phone, this can also make your phone work harder. Reply Felix on December 18, 2016 am using itel it 1355 but the above solutions cant work . help mi please Reply Trevor on December 18, 2016 what does it do when you boot? Are there any errors? You ve removed the battery and rebooted it, I assume. Have you looked to see if there are any buttons that are sticking or are there any external devices plugged into the USB or the micro-SD card slot? Try to remove them and see if it boots correctly. Reply Comesio Wa Banda on December 20, 2016 it 1355 cant accept all solutions listed above.. av tried one by one but to no avail and no keypads stuck plus it ddnt fell in water nor failing down from a pocket or so . the problem ctil persists Reply Trevor on December 20, 2016 It may require a hard reset.

You can ask for it back as-is and see if you can get it fixed locally. If you have insurance on the phone, you can make a claim.

Reply Milt MacFarlane on February 18, 2017 Thankyou so much all wonderful advice and indeed my volume down button doesn t work, thus staying in Safe Mode but before sending it away, to be fixed I need to back up 2 crucial 3rd party apps usually by Dropbox but it also doesn t appear in Safety mode any suggestions? Unfortunately I m not technical enough to know if rooting it can help, although I can follow explicit directions reasonably well the model is a Sony E2363 Aqua dual SIM Experia Reply Trevor on February 18, 2017 That s what safe mode does. it disables all the 3rd party apps and uses the default settings. It might not be as efficient, but you can send things to Dropbox through the browser.

Reply Vinay sharma on June 12, 2017 I just remove my SD card it s working OK. Virus and male are should be in your SD try this . ? Reply megan on June 13, 2017 This is a great tip. Viruses can be on internal or external memory. If the virus is just on external memory, solving performance issues and preventing the spread of the virus is often as simple as removing the card. Of course, if you want to recover files on that card, you ll still need to remove the virus, and you probably want to run a virus scan on your device even after the card is removed just to be safe.
