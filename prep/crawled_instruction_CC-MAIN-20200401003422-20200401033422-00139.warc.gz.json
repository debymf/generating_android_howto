Very easy...but one and only one way...and you can only do each track, or complete album 3 and only 3 times. You have to trick your android device into believing it is a computer by switching chrome browser to desk top. You have to access the google play music web site where your music (purchased & uploads are stored) by bookmark (only!). So, you have to enter the url then make it a bookmark. Then, after switching to desktop mode in your chrome browser, select the google play music bookmark. The url you need to enter is as follows: https://play.google.com/music/listen#/home It may ask you to log into your google account. It will then load your entire google play music library and you will be in the home directory. Simply select \"MUSIC LIBRARY\" then select \"ARTIST\" at the top bar. You can then select any artist in your library. It will show you several categories....go down to \"MY LIBRARY\" and select \"SEE ALL\". Simply pick an album...you can either download the whole album, or pick a track. To download the album click on the 3 dots...then select \"DOWNLOAD ALBUM\" in the pop up menu. It will take you to another pop up menu titled \"DOWNLOAD MUSIC\". Click on the underlined words \"download directly\". This will give you yet another pop up window also entitled \"DOWNLOAD MUSIC\". Click on the orange words \"DOWNLOAD NOW\"....and wait until its finished downloading. Your album will be a portable zipfile in your download directory on your android device. Unzip it and it will create the proper directories, artwork, trac numbers, everything, as mp3 files that can be ported, or played in any music player....my favorite is JetAudio....check it out.

Your article explaining how to get music from my Apple computer onto my Android phone was the only one I found that was truly helpful. So, thanks!! Reply Mark McGriff December 21, 2018 at 1:05 pm The work-around for the 1,000-song limit on playlists is to just make multiple, generic >1,000-song playlists. It takes very little time to do that. Once the playlists are downloaded to the phone, the songs can be manipulated in the GPM app by genre, etc., regardless of the fact that they were downloaded as playlists. Not sure if the playlists can be deleted after this method. Probably so, but there's really no reason to do so. Reply Me December 17, 2018 at 4:08 am If you change your download cache location to use your Sdcard, you dont need root, as all files will now be located on the sdcard.

Reply Annoyed User July 2, 2018 at 1:33 pm Like a fellow already mentioned - this does NOT WORK, since playlists are limited to 1.000 songs.

We don't have a monthly subsciption have purchase songs individually. I could use some advise. Reply {capachino} July 10, 2016 at 5:33 pm Yes, this is Thee method to to save all songs, from Google Play Music, to a smartphone so that they can accessed offline without the need for any data or even Wi-Fi usage. I recommend a (micro SD card Class 10) as storage for the music as well (I prefer Samsung SD cards because I've heard rumors of some problems that can arise with SanDisk. These problems may be totally false, but I just like to play it safe). The amount of storage (32gb, 64gb, 128gb) is up to you to decide. Reply Gabrielle May 27, 2016 at 11:32 am Thank you for this! Worked great and was exactly what I needed. Reply MAnny 215 May 13, 2016 at 9:37 am It's kind of ridiculous that I'd have to rename purchased mp3 names if I wanted to use them elsewhere. Sucks! Reply Rob May 12, 2016 at 1:53 pm While this idea seems great in concept, it fails because if you download via a playlist, those albums do not show up in your collection unless they are mp3's you own. So let's say you add a bunch of albums to a list, download it, and then want to listen to just one album from that list offline. You can't. Not unless you go to the playlist, find the album in it, and play from there. Obviously, this is pretty tedious. Especially if your playlists are not ordered well or if an album spans 2 lists because of that stupid 1000 limit. Playlists should add all of the albums (even if it has one song) to the library but Google does not think this is a good idea (they have told me that...for reasons). What I REALLY want to see, and I can't even believe this is not a thing, is the ability to indicate via the web that I want a song to be downloaded to my phone. This could be as simple as \"try to fit everything indicated into whatever space available\" or there could be profiles for your different devices. Much like Google Play has you choose where to install an app. If the former were implemented, the mobile apps could have a switch that says whether or not to allow auto-download of pinned songs. This is all a pipe dream though because I have given them feedback over and over and no one listens. They seem to think that everyone should just stream. Like we all have unlimited data or are always on wifi. Reply Rob May 12, 2016 at 1:56 pm Also, the nice thing about the web download tag is that if you get a new device...bam! All your metadata is saved and you don't have to go through the whole process again. I have about 8,000 songs offline and when you get to about 3-4K, the app slows to a CRAWL between hitting a button and a dialog opening. Reply Mathieu August 5, 2016 at 2:49 am I don't understand either why the songs in my playlists doesn't appear in the song tabs of my music library. I guess like you said that google think that everyone just stream. Reply Kevin September 12, 2016 at 4:26 am I am absolutely Blown Away by the sheer stupidity of this design decision.

This is the first workable solution I've come across, and although not perfect (due to the 1000 song playlist limit), it's closer than any other solution I've found. Please consider updating your article with some info about how to work around the 1000 song limit. I personally select the first 1000, take a note of what song is the 1000th, make a playlist called \"0-1000\", then repeat starting with the last song I had selected. A pain for sure, but again, better than the (lack of) alternatives. Reply Sam April 21, 2016 at 4:55 am There is an easier way to download all your songs. Just go to Playlists and download the \"Last Added\" Playlist. The Last Added Playlist is automatically generated by play music and it will always be up to date with all your songs.

Reply Trevor January 2, 2016 at 3:19 pm Nice suggestion. Spotify in addition to allowing downloading Playlists, Albums and Songs also allows you to download an artist which is very convenient. I started downloading albums after I had grabbed individual songs I liked from various artists, not realizing that google play grabs the whole album even if you have one song that you selected from the Album. That sucks. I'll do the above to keep my playlists under control. Reply Ace December 28, 2015 at 5:42 am Update!!!!

Reply SH June 2, 2014 at 5:22 pm This is a great article. Ever since switching from iTunes to Google Music I've been downloading my music to my phone one album at a time, so this article will be a great help. Three quick questions: (1) it seems that a playlist on Google music has a limit of 1000 songs - is there any way to get around that limit; (2) if the new playlist includes songs that are already on the phone, does the app skip those songs during download, or does it download a duplicate; and (3) if I don't have a rooted phone, can I plug the phone into the USB on my computer and use Windows to move the songs to a SD card. Again, many thanks for this article Reply Justin D June 2, 2014 at 5:40 pm Thanks :) glad to help. I went back and tested what you asked, and this is what I found. 1) I don't think there is a way around this. If you have more than 1,000 songs, I would suggest making multiple playlists of 1,000 songs each. 2) In my testing, it does NOT download a duplicate. Good news! 3) This is a GREAT question, because it led to this discovery: If you go into Play Music's settings and set it to save to an external SD card rather than internal (assuming you have an external microSD), you can easily access all the files on that microSD card without root access. However, if it saves the files locally, they seem to be hidden in a part only accessible with root access. So if you have a microSD slot and card for your phone, you could connect to your Windows computer and move the files off with no problem, but unfortunately it doesn't seem possible without an external microSD to save the offline files to. Reply SH June 2, 2014 at 8:09 pm I just completely filled up my internal storage. Seems that the option to save to SD card is device specific and I'm out of luck. Oh well, c'est la vie. Reply Rick June 2, 2014 at 3:08 pm \"for some reason, Google only allows each song to be downloaded to your computer twice. \" I'm pretty sure this two download limit does not apply if you use the Google Music Manager application: https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/1229970 Also, unless something has changed since I tested it when it first came out, that also was not the case if you used the new Google Play Music app for Chrome, at least on Chrome OS, as described here: http://www.omgchrome.com/browser-uploading-now-available-google-music/ And when using either of these options you get a file with the artist and song name.
