Then, drag the corners or sides of the frame to set the cropping area. Only the highlighted parts of the photo will remain. To enlarge the cropped selection, place two fingers on the screen and drag them apart. The app also offers presets to crop photos to specific aspect ratios and shapes. To use them, open the cropping tool, then tap the icon that looks like three boxes inside each other (on the right side, below the photo) to reveal a menu with presets. Tap the one you want. Tap Done in the lower-right corner to save your changes. To rotate a photo, tap the Crop icon. To turn a picture 90 degrees counter-clockwise, tap the Rotate icon (the square with the arrow next to it). Use it more than once to continue the rotation. For more free-form control over the rotation, move the compass-style wheel beneath the photo. Rotate the free-form control up to 45 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise.
