Reply dave October 2, 2013 at 1:21 am If you're looking at purchasing NHL Gamecenter, switch Hola's settings to the UK and you get the international rate of $99.95 USD rather than $159.95 USD. Reply Ash Nallawalla September 2, 2013 at 11:31 am \"Just head to Hola s settings you can t miss it!\" Unfortunately, I can't find these settings in Firefox. The icon is enabled and I can see the preloaded ones, but nothing resembling \"settings\". Even the Hola FAQ happily says that new scripts can be written, but nothing that says, \"Here is how a newbie can find a script and add it.\" Reply Justin P September 2, 2013 at 9:04 pm You'll find setting for Firefox extensions, including Hola, in the Add-Ons section of Firefox. Find Hola there, then click \"Preferences\". Reply Alan May 26, 2013 at 8:11 am I use ULTRASURF. It is faster and is a lightweight application.

Your use of the Software to download files will, in turn, enable other users to download pieces of those files from you, thereby maximizing download speeds for all users. You consent to other users' use of your network connection and resources in return for your potential use of other people's resources to assist you. Typically Hola will not enable use of your resources unless they are idle. Hola will also cache information on your hard drive for future use.

Reply Victor Ong May 20, 2013 at 5:02 am Will this work behind the Great Firewall of China? Reply Justin Pot May 20, 2013 at 1:46 pm I imagine that, if it did at some point, it's blocked now. China's pretty quick about disabling services like this...but you never know. Reply null May 20, 2013 at 2:46 am Amen. Something I have been waiting for a long time. Living outside the US sucks when it comes to the internet. Living 10 mins for the beach with sun... priceless Reply Justin Pot May 20, 2013 at 1:51 pm Stay where you are and bypass everything!

Reply Rajaa Chowdhury May 19, 2013 at 3:11 am I am very happy and satisfied with the utility of CyberGhost VPN which I have downloaded from MUO rewards for this same purpose. So I will give this one a skip. :) Reply Rajaa Chowdhury May 19, 2013 at 3:12 am Besides I need such utility only on my Desktop PC and not on my phone, so doesn't apply for me. Reply Joe May 19, 2013 at 12:21 am Could you write a step by step tutorial on how we can write our own scripts? Reply HolaScript May 19, 2013 at 5:01 am +1 for this!
