I also use hyperswitch and it works well. Reply Bart van Oers May 21, 2013 at 6:27 pm I use Moom to resize windows. When you hover over the green maximize button, a small bar pops up where you can choose how the window will resize, ex. left, right or full screen. It's also possible to assign keyboard shortcuts. When I press cmd+arrow left, the window resizes to the left half of the screen. When I press cmd-arrow up, the window goes full screen. Everything is customizable. Love it. Reply Samarth Hegde May 17, 2013 at 2:55 pm but we cant get a complete windows feel and how ever if we are using mac laptops we wont have windows button in the keyboard and the functions remains the same according to ios Reply Justin Pot May 17, 2013 at 4:38 pm Want a complete Windows feel? Install Windows. It's not hard to do on a Mac. Reply null May 26, 2013 at 3:58 pm Sadly osx is very restrictive and locked platform, its not very custumizable, i don't think you will be able to make it feel much more like wIndows. Most stuff is already covered in this article. Reply Pooky Joralyn May 17, 2013 at 8:23 am The most stupid thing on OSX is its menu bar. I have to move the mouse to the top every time, and it depends on the active window too! Worse still, I can't even find anything whenever I forget which one is the active window. Reply Jakob May 17, 2013 at 6:39 am I m not totally sure i understand what you miss about the command + tab feature.. But i think http://bahoom.com/hyperswitch (Same company who made Hyperdock) may solve the problem :) (Free beta) While talking about great Mac apps, I just have to mention one of my favorites.. Totalfinder.. http://totalfinder.binaryage.com - Gives you tabs in your Finder and let you split your Finder window into two, just like good old Total Commander back in the Dos days :) I did not knew Bartender. Seems to be something i was missing :) Thanks Reply shawn May 17, 2013 at 3:05 am i'm a new osX convert, wife ran win 7 i used mainly ubuntu or derivitive....and still do, now my biggest complaint, make the damn red close button kill the app/program not just the window and when you click the dock icon, resume the window status. does not doing otherwise serve a purpose? not being glib, really am curious at the logic behind it.. Reply Justin Pot May 17, 2013 at 4:37 pm I guess it's so you can leave the app running after you've closed all windows something Windows itself doesn't really offer you a way to do. I like it, myself, but then again I use Command+Q when I actually want to close a program entirely. Reply Gideon Waxfarb May 17, 2013 at 12:48 am Do either OSX or Linux have a good Autohotkey alternative? My favorite feature is being able to set up shortcut keys on a per-application level. So, for example, whether I'm in a text editor, web browser, or whatever, CTRL+T always opens a new tab. It's handy when you don't have to remember different hotkeys for different apps :) Reply Kevin Clinthorne May 17, 2013 at 12:04 am Missed the boat on the fact that osx does have a shortcut that is 100% identical to alt-tab, it is command-tab. It looks and functions almost exactly the same Reply Justin Pot May 17, 2013 at 12:19 am But it's not: alt-tab switches by windows; command-tab switches by application. It's a subtle difference, unless you have multiple windows of the same program open. Then it can be very annoying. Reply Jay S May 16, 2013 at 11:26 pm I was just noticing the icon of a rocket on a field of silver-cd earlier tonight, clicked on it & saw \"Launchpad\" if not for the first time, at least the first time recently, and I immediately thought...\"this is dumb.\" But then, I use ubuntu about 90% of the time and OSX the other 10 percent. I gave up on Windows about two to three years ago. I don't *hate* it, but I don't *use* it either. Reply Paul S May 16, 2013 at 10:38 pm How about being able to have a blank desktop behind a program similar the way windoze does it. I hate it when you accidentally click on the desktop and end up on the finder instead of remaining in the program. I agree with Doc about having the menu bar on the program instead of the top of the window. This would help immensely when running multiple monitors (as I do) and you keep a text editor for note taking on the second or third monitor and the menu is all the way on the other side of the arrangement. Reply Bill May 16, 2013 at 10:49 pm There's an app called SecondBar that puts a menu on my second monitor. And there's a great program called Window Magnet that lets you snap your windows so they become half-screen, full screen or even quarter screen. Reply Bill May 16, 2013 at 10:50 pm Does anyone know of a program that can put the Dock on both screens if you're using a second monitor? Reply Justin Pot May 16, 2013 at 10:58 pm I've looked, and have found no such thing. I'd be thrilled if someone else found it, though... Reply Doc May 16, 2013 at 11:26 pm I guess that's something else nobody has found a reason to do. Seriously, if somebody doesn't think something is *possible*, they'll never ask for it. Justin Pot May 16, 2013 at 11:56 pm Very few people contemplate what's possible before requesting features, and fewer hackers care about it before they start a project. If enough people wanted this it would exist. Doc May 16, 2013 at 8:47 pm You forgot the one thing Mac users didn't know they needed: attaching the menu bar to the app instead of the top of the screen. Seriously, if I want to put a text editing window near the bottom of the screen (which I do for Web development, so I can see most of the site I'm working on in the exposed browser window above), why would I have to go *all the way to the top of the screen* to access the menu? Windows attaches the menu bar *to the window*, where it's always the same short distance. Mac's menu bar is a relic of its 1984 past. Time to fix it. Reply Justin Pot May 16, 2013 at 8:53 pm I think having the menu bar up top is cleaner, and was thrilled to see Ubuntu go one step further by hiding the menu when it's not in use. After all: if efficiency is that important, learn the keyboard shortcuts. Microsoft, for its part, seems hellbent on removing menus altogether: they're nowhere to be found in Metro and Office ditched them way back in 2007. But whatever, to each their own. I don't want my menus attached to my Windows, but the lack of Mac apps to do this suggests no one else wants it badly enough to build the product. Maybe you'll be the one to bring this feature to the Mac and show us all what we've been missing. :) Reply Doc May 16, 2013 at 11:30 pm Metro is optimized for touch screens, so its \"menus\" are buttons attached to a long-press event, and Office 2007 & 2010 still has menus; for example, Excel 2007's \"Home\" menu has \"Clipboard,\" \"Font,\" etc. that expand into the Ribbon, plus \"Insert,\" \"Page Layout,\" \"Formulas,\" etc. menus that fill the Ribbon when selected; there's just no way to close the menu without hiding the entire Ribbon. Reply Justin Pot May 16, 2013 at 11:41 pm If ribbons count as menus so do the plentiful toolbars in most Mac apps, though. And they're usually customizable, meaning there's no reason you'll ever have to use the menu for features you use regularly. Again, it's all a mater of preference, and from your perspective this is valid. Personally, I prefer the lack of clutter to having quick access to windows, but I rarely move my windows too far from the top of the screen in any case. All about your personal workflow, I guess. Christopher Webb May 16, 2013 at 8:31 pm Thanks for the QuickLock tip, I was looking for something like that. Reply Josh May 17, 2013 at 1:47 pm There's a hidden keyboard command already present in OSX to automatically lock the screen: Ctrl+Shift+Eject Reply Dave S May 17, 2013 at 2:19 pm I was going to add this one because it's one of the shortcuts I use the most. Every time I step away from a Mac, unless it's a presentation machine and has to be showing an image, I do press Ctrl+Shift+Eject. On my Retina Macbook Pro there is no eject button so I use the power button in the top right along with Ctrl+Shift and it does the same thing. Reply Zhong J May 16, 2013 at 8:15 pm This feature is also accessible within a Linux system, as it's far more customizable and I think this article would suit better with users running a Linux system; not everyone owns OSX with a price tag. As there's somewhat vague distinguishable between Windows and OSX, due to the fact OSX is more linux friendly and is considered to be WIndows made by Linux. Reply Justin Pot May 16, 2013 at 8:36 pm Statistically more people use Macs than Linux, but that's beside the point. I love Linux, and am a longtime user, but not every article can be about it. I try to cover all three systems. :) Reply dragonmouth May 16, 2013 at 11:57 pm \"but not every article can be about it\" Not every one of YOUR articles can be about Linux. I can understand that it may get boring after a while. However, you are one of the few MUO writers, if not the only one, who consistently writes about Linux. Linux articles are few and far between on MUO. Most of the articles are about Windows, iOS or Android. Linux seems to be a forgotten or ignored O/S at MUO. From the comments posted, many of MUO's readers either know Linux or use it. I certainly would welcome more Linux articles. \"I try to cover all three systems.\" No need for you to try to be evenhanded. Your colleagues do a bang up job of covering Windows and Mac ad nauseam. Reply michel May 17, 2013 at 2:28 am Speaking for myself, I prefer sites that focus on a single platform. I only use one. I do sometimes read about others, but I'd still rather visit specific sites. For instance, I run Windows (which is best for what I do) but I like to keep an eye on Ubuntu. So I mostly visit windows sites and sometimes read OMG Ubuntu. Scott M May 17, 2013 at 12:13 pm I have Linux along side windows and I agree more info about would be a real boon.I'm just a new user with the system and would appreciate more useful tips and info on Linux.Now I only learn by trial and error.Which is good in some ways as it reinforces my learning in anything I've deduced on my own.However I know my capabilities and it would be nice to see more discussion of what is available for the operating system in the way of shortcuts,new programs or hacks. Justin Pot May 17, 2013 at 2:16 pm Danny writes about Linux more often than me, I'd say. And overall we write far more Linux articles than is representational of our readership's usage our readers are currently overwhelmingly Windows users. Someone with more access can speak to the numbers. Even with that, we are trying to do more Linux stuff though I'm having trouble thinking of article ideas compared to two years ago. Just feels like less is happening in Linux-land these days. Even OMG Ubuntu posts way less than it used to...", "url": "https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/a-perfect-operating-system-getting-windows-style-features-in-os-x/", "index": 0}
