On the next screen, enter the recipient's name, $Cashtag, phone number, or email. To find all of your friends, tap Enable Contacts which will give Cash App access your smartphone's contact list and allow you to see which of your contacts have Cash App installed. Make sure the recipient is correct. If you send money to the wrong person, you may not be able to recover your money! If you have more than one type of payment method set up (for example, a debit card AND a credit card) you'll want to specify the funding source before you pay. The funding source dropdown is located at the top of the screen (circled in yellow below). To complete the transfer, tap Pay in the top right corner of the screen. If successful, you'll receive a confirmation that payment was sent. After you've sent the payment, the recipient will be notified of the payment.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/use-cash-app-on-smartphone-4779659", "index": 0}
