What should I do now ? Saptashwa April 30, 2011 at 2:54 pm Go to the wrench icon, then to \"Tools\"-> \"Extensions\". There will be an option for each of the extensions to be \"Allow in Incognito\". That will make them work fine. Tina April 30, 2011 at 5:33 am Niks, there sort of is. Chrome doesn't record your browsing history when you're in incognito mode. If you want this option to be enabled by default, you need to launch Chrome in incognito mode by default . When you only need it occasionally, you can manually launch a separate Chrome window in incognito mode. Niks April 30, 2011 at 5:44 am It worked Thank You.", "url": "https://www.makeuseof.com/answers/never-remember-history-option-chrome-11-firefox/", "index": 0}
