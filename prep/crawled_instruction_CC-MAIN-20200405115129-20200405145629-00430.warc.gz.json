We would love to hear your comments and suggestions. Reply Justin December 21, 2018 at 2:12 am I think you do your readers a great disservice when you make such a broad claim as \"absolutely NO FREE VPN service works with Netflix\" simply because you subscribe to the rediculous notion that it's possible for you to test every vpn provider that exists on the planet earth whether it be in the past, present and future. Narrow-minded self importance does not, nor will it ever, impress me. Thankfully I have tested a free VPN service available in the form of a browser extension (or an installable windows executable file that can be found elseware on the web but for some reason is not available on the official website [anymore?]) that has, does and likely will continue to work for Netflix in the forseeable future - for reasons that I won't go into here but is information that can easily be found on their official website explaining what apparently makes it different from other free vpn servers. It's called Tuxler. Now, go try it out and then I think you owe us all an sincere apology for making such a silly statement. If I have learned anything when it comes to computers and the internet as well as life in general it's this: anything is possible. Reply Bem November 5, 2018 at 1:49 pm NordVPN still works fine for me. I was already getting ready mentally for the day to come when I will not be able to access US Netflix with Nord anymore, but it hasn t come yet. It s been a year since my mate told me he wasn t able to access it with another VPN that he used at the time and I barely get any problems when using Nord. Some servers are blocked of course, but the majority of the newer ones are always up and running so you just need to switch the server a couple of times at most. If anyone is still struggling to find a working vpn go for it, they have awesome deal for Black Friday that they ve been sending trough on emails, the code was vpn3y or 3ysale can t remember which one, but let me know if any of these work. Reply David Martin October 21, 2018 at 8:29 pm In your article it says: Netflix Countries: ExpressVPN only worked for US consistently. Some of the other nations, especially Canada, end up working at times, but it s not a connection you can bank on. Does this mean that if you have a US Account with NetFlix and you want to use it in another country it would not be reliable? More importantly if you use ExpressVPN, or any of the other ones you mention, will this work only with a computer browser? I have little interest in watching movies in a browser on computer but want to use my Apple TV 4K (connected to my home WiFi) to display the show on my large TV. Will this work?

I have tried all of the Proxy above and none of them are really free or actually work... A lot of them are either premium or they only give you free access to countries like Danemark or Germany and ask you to go premium to unlock the popular ones like United states... So, for all of you who were searching for a free Vpn who works well, I have finally found one after hours of search and testing! UltraSurf is totally free and works on Netflix !However, it is different, you can't choose a country you only can turn it on or off... But once you trun it on, it unlocks the US Netflix so I do not complain! :) I used it yesterday so I'm pretty sure it will still work today! ;) It is available as an extension to google chrome which I use but I think you can download it if you go on their website! Anyways I hope my comment will help a lot of people who were in my situation and will save them a lot of time searching for a good proxy!

Reply tony July 6, 2016 at 5:33 am Well I've cancelled Netflix subscription after over 4 years use (surely not that long???). I move about, I have used proxies and VPNS, but I would be quite willing to pay extra to be able to keep watching when not in US or UK. Where I am now I get German Netflix, which has a poor selection and the range of titles tend to be restricted to violent or overtly sexual content which I do not want to watch. The crazy thing is that I have been strongly against watching pirated films, I appreciate the film industry needs paying for their work, but it's time they woke up to the simple fact that we are in a global market and their geographic restrictions are last century. but is there an option for me? So now I shall save money, the distributors don't get their contribution from me and Netflix looses another customer. Quite a clever way to destroy the film industry I suppose.

I would like to point out that we have built a package for Microsoft Windows (EXE) that does all the Smart DNS setting technical work behind-the-scenes, and therefore is suitable for all users. It can be downloaded from https://www.keenow.com/ We are pushing extra R&D effort that our proxy servers will continue and unblock Netflix US as well as a bunch of other US streaming platforms, with the aim of providing our service for free for anyone to use. Kind regards, Isaac Cohen, CEO Keen Media Group Reply tj October 3, 2016 at 12:01 am Get lost spamming Joo boy.

We are in the process of making the free Keenow Free Smart DNS app easier to use for everyone. As a first step, we have developed a Windows application that does all the DNS changes behind-the-scenes (EXE). It can be downloaded from our homepage: https://www.keenow.com We truly believe that international web users shouldn't be discriminated compared to US users, and our goal is to unblock Netflix US at all times (as well as more than 80 other US streaming platforms) - and for free! -Isaac Cohen, Keen Media Group Reply maNel September 4, 2016 at 3:38 pm So far it hasn't worked at all, I tried using Keenow and it doesn't work :/ Reply scubarang May 17, 2016 at 1:24 am Hotspot works but is only free for a three day trial period.

Google VPN Server router and you will find some. Then you can connect to this router from Canada, Mexico or else where using IPSecure or IKEv2. These VPN are supported by Android, Iphone and Windows Phone. NetFlix will not block this setup because it belongs to a residential internet service. And there will be no VPN subscription fee.

Reply Michail Drakomathioulakis May 11, 2016 at 2:17 am All this licensing issue is simply bullshit coming from a previous era! In the era of internet, georestrictions is the most annoying thing ever! I liked Netflix, much thanks to its original content, but I decided to cancel my subscription because I find it totally unacceptable to have to wait months or even years in order to be able to legally watch a movie or a series, simply because I live in a small country in Europe. Plus, all this without subtitles, which can be an issue at times. Reply Ur May 10, 2016 at 9:19 pm Im using HydemyAss and it's definitely not working on Netflix, Hulu, Bravo etc,,, I cant unsuscribe as I paid for a year (running until december). I am very annoyed as I purchased this vpn to watch us programs Reply Don Gateley May 10, 2016 at 7:35 pm What I want is a browser plugin (FF in my case) that causes a tab to bypass my VPN and go direct so that I can keep my VPN up for general privacy and security while yielding to specific sites like Netflix for their geolocation restrictions. I don't know if that is technically possible, however. Reply TibeRiuS May 10, 2016 at 5:18 pm Netflix is watching!! Reply Darek May 10, 2016 at 3:23 pm Unblock us it'd not working .
