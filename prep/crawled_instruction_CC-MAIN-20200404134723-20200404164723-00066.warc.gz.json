Tap the Camera app to open it. Swipe the bar along the bottom to Portrait . With Portrait selected, the app will suggest how to capture the best image, such as moving closer or farther away, and turning on the flash. The app should auto-detect a person or a face (if they're in the image). White viewfinder frames appear on the image around them automatically. When the viewfinder frames turn yellow, take the image by tapping the onscreen camera button or clicking the volume down button.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/portrait-mode-and-portrait-lighting-on-iphone-4156748", "index": 0}
