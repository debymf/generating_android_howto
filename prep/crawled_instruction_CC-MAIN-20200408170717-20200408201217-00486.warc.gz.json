Little peices of paper just end up everywhere, except where I need them. So, when I'm handed a business card, I open Keep and take a pic. Doctor gives me an app card - take a pic. Parked on big parking garage take a pic of where I parked and add some notes. Poster with details about a new knitting group at local library with phone number, etc - take a pic. Later, at home or somewhere with free wifi, I can capture the text in most of these pics. Click on the dots, click grab image text. Turn notes into reminders as necessary. You get the idea. Next I want to add the local pizza delivery menu. Reply Saikat Basu July 21, 2017 at 4:44 am Yes, Tamie. Google Keep is very versatile. Something which doesn't appear so from its simple interface. Reply Tamie Hamilton-Lavoie July 24, 2017 at 6:09 pm the simpler the interface, the better, really Reply Tamie Hamilton-Lavoie July 24, 2017 at 6:35 pm You know what would make Keep just that much better? (I've mentioned this elsewhere, but I'm going to keep trying...) It would be *awesome* if I could import a pinterest board into Keep, edit it, and re-upload it. The last step is actually optional. I have a number of boards where the whole pinterest board is just for one project, and they look nice, and are convenient to save to as I'm researching something, but in the actual making of the item, they're very inconvenient and keep is much better there. It would also be terrific if the words could wrap around the graphics. Imagine, if you will, a board or collection of pinterest pins that are all about creating a kitchen herb garden, and all the ways that different people believe is *the best way*. One with notes and illustrations from the book \"Square Foot Gardening\" that you've scanned from your copy, and a pins with photos & illustrations of your fav herbs, with notes about the best places to source your seeds and sprouts. And, maybe a few pins about tomatoes, a couple about composting. A couple of days or even weeks, before you buy your bags of earth, lumber, shovels, etc; you sit down and look at the pins and make a plan. You can see pretty clearly at this point how hard it is to do a \"step 1, step 2... \" kind of plan from pins directly. They're pretty, but all the text is sort of behind the pictures. With keep, the opposite is true - all the text is \"in front\" with a collection of links at the bottom to the pix. They both come very close to being electronic index cards.
