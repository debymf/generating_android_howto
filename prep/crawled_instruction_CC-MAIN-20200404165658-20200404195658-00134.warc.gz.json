On a smartphone, tap Settings (or screen mirroring icon), choose where to play media (or similar step), then select your LG smart TV from the device list. It might take a few moments for the phone to detect the TV. In the remaining steps, the phone (HTC Android) is on the left and the LG TV screen is on the right. Tap the LG TV listed to Initiate the connection procedure on your smartphone. The phone and TV will display their connection status. Your smartphone's or tablet's screen will be displayed on the LG TV when the procedure is completed. In most cases, smartphone content, onscreen menus, and setting options will be displayed on the LG TV screen. Here's how mirrored content from a smartphone looks on an LG Smart TV with Screen Share. To end a screen mirroring session, tap Disconnect in your smartphone screen mirroring settings (if provided), turn the smartphone off, change to a different function on the TV, or turn the TV off. If you're playing content from a specific app, it will cease playing if you use another function on your smartphone.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/screen-mirroring-lg-smart-tvs-4770959", "index": 0}

Open a compatible app (YouTube or Netflix) on your Android phone. For casting using the DIAL system to work, the app you're casting needs to be installed on the smartphone or tablet and TV. Tap the Cast icon at the top of the screen of the chosen app, then tap the LG Smart TV as the device you want to Cast to. If an app has a cast icon, but the LG TV isn't listed, this means the content can't be cast to the LG TV without the addition of an external Chromecast device. Now you can watch the content you selected on your smartphone on the LG Smart TV.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/screen-mirroring-lg-smart-tvs-4770959", "index": 1}
