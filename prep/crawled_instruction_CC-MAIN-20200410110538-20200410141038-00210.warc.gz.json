Tap the microphone icon represented by a blue circle in the middle of the toolbar at the bottom of your screen. Select the ALLOW button to grant the Alexa app access to your device's microphone, if prompted. You might also be prompted to try Alexa. Just follow the on-screen instructions to continue; this prompt won't occur in the future. Once Alexa is ready to hear your command or question, the screen will become darker and a pulsating blue line will appear at the bottom of your screen. You'll also see a sample text prompt, such as Just ask, \"Alexa, order dog food\" . Simply speak into your smartphone at this point as if you were talking to your Echo device.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/control-amazon-echo-by-phone-4158356", "index": 0}
