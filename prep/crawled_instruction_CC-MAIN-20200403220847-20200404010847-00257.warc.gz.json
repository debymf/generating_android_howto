Click the tools icon in the upper right corner of your account. Under Measurement, click Conversions . Click the plus button . Click Import . Under Select what you want to import: choose Other data sources or CRMs, and then Track conversions from calls. Click Continue . Complete the settings for your new conversion action, and keep in mind that: When you enter a conversion name, it's important that you remember the exact spelling of the name. You ll need to enter this name later, when you upload your call conversion information. The Include in Conversions setting is selected by default. Uncheck it if you don't want to include data for this conversion action in your \"Conversions\" reporting column. However, even if you uncheck this setting, the data will still be included in the \"All conversions\" column. You might want to use this setting if you use an automated bid strategy to optimize for conversions, and you don't want to include this particular conversion action in your bid strategy. Learn more about the \"Include in 'Conversions'\" setting. If you have other conversion actions that track the same calls for example, if you already have a conversion action to track calls from ads, and plan to track the same calls with your import calls conversion action you should only include one of these conversion actions in the Conversions column. Including both will result in counting 2 conversions for every call and, if you optimize your bidding for conversions, bidding for 2 conversions for each call. We recommend checking the Include in Conversions setting for your import calls conversion action, and unchecking the setting for any other conversion actions that track the same calls. Click Create and continue . Choose one of the following options: If you just want to track calls from a number in your ads, click Done to finish creating your conversion action.

This option shows the full global site tag. To install the tag, copy the tag code and paste it between the <head></head> tags of every page of your website. Here s an example of a global site tag, where CONVERSION_ID stands for the conversion ID that s unique to your Google Ads account: <script async src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=AW-CONVERSION_ID\"></script> <script> window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []; function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);} gtag('js', new Date()); gtag('config', 'AW-CONVERSION_ID'); </script> I installed the global site tag on my website from another Google product (example: Google Analytics) or from another Google Ads account: If this option applies to you, you won t need to add the global site tag to your website again; however, for conversion tracking to work for this account, you ll need to add the config command (the piece of code that contains your conversion ID) to every instance of the global site tag. This option shows that command, where AW-CONVERSION_ID stands for your account s conversion ID: gtag('config', 'AW-CONVERSION_ID'); Add the config command to every instance of the global site tag on your website, right above the </script> end tag.

Just make sure that the global site tag appears on every page of your site and that the config command in each instance of the tag contains your account s conversion ID. You ll see your conversion ID when you select this option. (Optional) Modify the global site tag based on your preferences: If you don t want the global site tag to add website visitors to your remarketing lists, add the highlighted portion below to your global site tag s config command: gtag('config', ' AW-CONVERSION_ID ', {'send_page_view': false}); If you don t want the global site tag to set first-party cookies on your site s domain, add the highlighted portion below to your global site tag s config command: gtag('config', ' AW-CONVERSION_ID ', {'conversion_linker': false}); We don t recommend doing this as it will lead to less accurate conversion measurement. Copy the global site tag, then follow the instructions to add it to your website . Next to Phone snippet, select one of the following options: Enter your phone number as it appears on your website. Enter the phone number that you want to track calls to. Make sure to enter the exact digits that appear on your website. For example, if the number on your website has a country code, include the country code here. If the number on your website does not have a country code, do not include the country code here. Then, click Create snippet . (Note that this option doesn t work if you want to track multiple phone numbers on your website.) Example : You list the number on your website as 1-650-555-5555. You should enter the number as 1-650-555-5555. If you enter 650-555-5555, or 555-5555, Google Ads won t be able to properly find your number and track your conversions. Don t enter a number. You ll need to edit your website code manually. If you select this option, you ll need to follow the instructions below to edit your website code manually after you install your tag. This option is more advanced, and is recommended only if you re comfortable using JavaScript. You should use this option if you want to track calls to multiple phone numbers on your website. Under Install the phone snippet, you ll now see the code for the phone snippet based on the option you selected. Copy the snippet to add it to your website now, or click Download snippet to add it later. Open up the HTML for the page where the phone number appears on your website.

You can also follow the steps below to download a template. If you want Google Ads to import your conversions automatically on a regular schedule (see Step 5: Import your conversions ), you need to use Google Sheets or store the file online with HTTPS or SFTP. If any of the conversions you import are within one day of the click, Google Ads may not be able to record them yet. As a best practice, upload an extra day's worth of data with each import. Google Ads won t count duplicate conversions. Sign in to your Google Ads account . Click the tools icon in the upper right corner of your account. Under Measurement, click Conversions .

If your conversion times are in different time zones, add the time zone to each conversion time using the Conversion Time column. See the instructions and table under Call start time in step 4 below. If you don t enter a time zone in the Parameters row, delete the Parameters row. Or, you can enter a time zone in both the Parameters row and the Conversion Time. Conversion Time will be used first, and if any conversion is missing the time zone, the Parameters value will be used. Use one of the following formats to enter the time zone: If your call start times and conversion times are in different time zones, add the time zone to each call start time and conversion time using the Conversion Time column. See the instructions and table under Call start time in step 4 below. If you don t enter a time zone in the Parameters row, delete the Parameters row. Or, you can enter a time zone in both the Parameters row and the Call Start Time and Conversion Time. The time zone in the columns will be used first. If the time zone is missing from either column, the Parameters value will be used. Enter your time zone ID from this list . This method is recommended to avoid errors during daylight savings time transitions. Enter your GMT offset by indicating + or - and then the 4 digit time difference. (For example, New York's offset is -0500, and Berlin's is +0100). If you use Greenwich Mean Time, then simply enter +0000. Next, add a new row for each conversion, filling in the columns as follows: Caller's phone number : The phone number must be listed in one of the following supported formats: Call start time : The time the call started. You can add a time zone to the call start time by using one of the last 4 formats listed. Replace +z with the GMT offset by indicating + or - and then the 4 digit time difference. (For example, New York's offset is -0500, and Berlin's is +0100). Or, replace \"zzzz\" with the time zone ID from this list . Here s a list of supported date formats: Conversion name : The name of the conversion action that you'd like to import this conversion for. It's important that you use the exact same spelling and capitalization that you did when you created this conversion action in your Google Ads account. Conversion time (optional): The date and time that the conversion occurred. See acceptable formats under Call start time above. Conversion value (optional): A number representing the value that you place on the conversion. It could reflect a currency value, or you could simply choose to enter relative values of 0-10 (negative numbers are not accepted). If you leave this field blank, Google Ads will automatically apply the \"conversion value\" that you defined when you created your conversion action. If you do include a value here, it will override the value you defined when you created your conversion action. Conversion currency (optional): The currency in which your conversion value is provided. You'll use this if you report conversion values in more than one currency, or have multiple accounts that are billed in different currencies.
