It s the map icon labeled Google Maps. You ll usually find it on the home screen. If you haven t yet enabled location services or calibrated the compass , you should do so before you continue. In addition to GPS/the compass, Google Maps can also use Wi-Fi and local cell towers to find your location. For the most accurate results, connect to Wi-Fi and/or your cellular data network. [4] Image titled Calibrate the Compass on Google Maps on iPhone or iPad Step 15 2 Tap the location icon. It s on the right side of the map, toward the bottom. Look for a solid gray dot surrounded by a gray circle with 4 directional points. The map will re-center to display your current location as a blue dot surrounded by a lighter blue circle. Within the lighter blue circle is a darker blue beam. This beam is aimed in the direction your phone or tablet is pointing. Image titled Calibrate the Compass on Google Maps on iPhone or iPad Step 16 3 Troubleshoot location issues. If the blue dot doesn t appear or is gray, Google Maps cannot find your location. Make sure location services are enabled , and that you re connected to either a Wi-Fi or data network. If the location of the blue dot is incorrect, it could be due to physical obstructions between you and cellular towers (such as tall buildings or structures). You may also need to restart your phone or tablet. Advertisement", "url": "https://www.wikihow.com/Calibrate-the-Compass-on-Google-Maps-on-iPhone-or-iPad", "index": 2}
