Scroll down to the Backups section for more options. The Latest Backups section tells you when you last saved your data. It provides the date and time of your last backups both to iCloud and to the computer you're using. This section also lets you customize the settings for backups. Click the button next to This computer under the Automatically Back Up heading to store your information locally. Click the box next to Encrypt local backup to add another layer of protection to your data. Encrypting local backups also lets you include passwords, HomeKit information, and Health data to your file. You can't back up these files unless you choose this option. Click Change Password to set or update the code protecting your backup. Check the box next to Remember this password in my keychain to keep from having to enter the code to restore your device from a backup. Leaving this box unchecked will keep your backups more secure. With the password saved, anyone with access to your computer will be able to use your backup. Enter and confirm your password, and then click Change Password to save it. Two buttons will create a backup of your device. Back Up Now saves all of your data to the computer.

Click the stolen iPhone that has the card you want to remove to open it in a new window. Underneath the iPhone image is a list of the cards you have listed in your iPhone. Choose Remove All .
