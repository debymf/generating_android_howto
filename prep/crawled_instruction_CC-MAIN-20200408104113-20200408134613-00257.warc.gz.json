Before you try anything more complicated, try rebooting your phone. It's a simple fix that works a lot of the time. After your phone has finished rebooting, try using Google Assistant again. Check your internet connectivity . Google Assistant relies on an internet connection to process your commands. Make sure that you have a reliable data connection, or connect your phone to Wi-Fi, and try using Google Assistant again. Make sure Google Assistant can hear you. If Google Assistant doesn't respond at all, it may not be able to hear you. Try moving to a quiet area if you're in a loud place. If you're already in a quiet area, check your phone's microphone to make sure it isn't obstructed by dust or other debris . Try a different command. Google Assistant accepts several different commands that all cause it to open an app. If saying \"open Gmail\" doesn't work, try saying \"launch Gmail\" or \"play Gmail.\" If Google Assistant works with one command, and not with others, retraining the voice model may help. Open the Google app, then navigate to More > Settings > Voice > Voice Match > Retrain voice model . Then tap More , and say the indicated phrases clearly into your phone's microphone. Clear the Google app cache. Corrupt local data is one of the most common causes of Google Assistant refusing to open anything. To take care of this problem, you'll have to clear the cache of your Google app. Open Settings > Apps & notifications . Then tap Google > Storage > Clear Cache . If Google Assistant still won't open anything, move on to the next step. Clear all Google app local data. In some cases, clearing the Google app cache isn't enough. The next step is to clear all of the locally stored data, which includes things like your search history and feed settings. Open Settings > Apps & notifications > Google > Storage > Clear Storage . Then tap CLEAR ALL DATA > OK . Roll back the Google app. The last thing you can try with the Google app is to uninstall updates to the app and then reinstall the app. Open Settings > Apps & notifications > Google > the (three vertical dots) menu icon > Uninstall updates . If Google Assistant works, don't update the Google app until Google issues a fix. If it doesn't work, then try updating the app. You can download the Google app directly from Google Play . If Google Assistant still won't open anything but works with limited commands like web searches, the problem might be your phone's smart lock .", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/google-assistant-wont-open-anything-4584886", "index": 0}

Enter your PIN , pattern , or password . Turn off on-body detection , and remove all of the trusted devices , places , faces , and voice match voices. Reboot your phone, and check to see if Google Assistant will open apps. If Google Assistant works, either leave Smart Lock off or add each method back one at a time, starting with voice match. You might be able to use smart lock in a limited fashion, or you might have to leave it off altogether to use Google Assistant. If Google Assistant still doesn't work, even with all smart lock features disabled, you'll have to wait for Google to release a fix for the bug that's causing issues on your phone.
