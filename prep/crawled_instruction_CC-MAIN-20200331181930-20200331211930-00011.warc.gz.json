Reply Anonymous December 4, 2015 at 3:51 am Calibre is powerful, but the interface is a little ugly I think, and especially when I used Plugin to remove DRM, I think it a little complicated. I used an alternative, epubor ultimate eBook converter. Reply Donald Richardson March 17, 2013 at 5:50 am There is so much info on MUO that I have only just found this! This is one I really must have! Thanks for this post. Reply Jeremy Garnett February 7, 2013 at 3:03 am Thanks. I didn't know about the plugins. Reply Loris Johnston January 26, 2013 at 4:26 am I have used calibre in the past. For the third time, I experienced a total loss of library. You CAN reinstate the library from metadata db. It DOES NOT reinstate your own catalogues (categories). If you have a large library, to redo this is time consuming to say the least. When I contacted calibre regarding this, the only thing they had to say was that the library could be restored from the metadata (which I stated in my original communication that I had done). Further in the same communication said that my \"bug\" was invalid. I have a library of a little over 300 books at the moment. Imagine a 10,000 book library! Reply Jeremy Garnett February 7, 2013 at 3:11 am I'm not sure about reinstating the library from metadata, but you can create a calalog of books through the Convert function. There's a great guide here: http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=118556 Reply Heather January 23, 2013 at 3:21 pm The only reason I'm not using it is that it makes duplicates of files you already have. Why does everything have to be in Calibre's specified folder? Can't it just make a database of file locations for ebooks elsewhere in your hard drive? I don't want to fully rely on a management system for organizing ebooks, it should also respect how I organize my files into intuitive folders. Reply Dan January 27, 2013 at 10:54 pm This is one of the most frequently asked questions on mobilereads. Unfortunately the calibre community is not only completely set in their way, they are disgustingly arrogant about it. Their typical answer is that people who don't see the calibre way are stupid and that calibre is not for them. Imagine an mp3 player, that would copy all imported mp3s into its own file structure. That would be totally ridiculous. Calibre could be a nice program, but as long as you have to copy all files into their structure and can't keep links to outside files, exactly like any other media library does, it's just unusable. And no, having a database with tagging and search etc. does not require all files to be kept in a black box. -1 for the arrogant and unhelpful community. Reply Aaron Couch January 27, 2013 at 11:12 pm Dan & Heather, You both bring very valid points and thank you for sharing this. It's too bad that it isn't different, but hopefully it will change in the near future. Thanks again for commenting. Reply Dan February 1, 2013 at 5:26 am Hi Aaron, Here is their official answer: http://manual.calibre-ebook.com/faq.html#why-doesn-t-app-let-me-store-books-in-my-own-directory-structure \"If you are still not convinced, then I m afraid calibre is not for you. Look elsewhere for your book cataloguing needs. Just so we re clear, this is not going to change. Kindly do not contact us in an attempt to get us to change this.\" But after all I am very optimistic about them relenting at some point. They say that if you sort your folders by author, you can't access them by subject, and that sorting in calibre is much more powerful than by file folder. Of course, that's totally right, but that's what you want to use calibre for, so you can browse independently from your folders. Whether the files are stored inside of calibre's black box, or in your folders is in no way related to how they are indexed by calibre. You could still search for a book by author, date, tag, subject or whatever you like, just that the path points to your external folder!!!!!! And if you have accidentally moved a file, calibre could just ask for the new location of the file. I'd say nearly every media library (zotero, itunes, media player) works that way. I tried zotero, and it does exactly do what calibre says can't be done: It does all the indexing, tagging and sorting for you, but allows you to keep files in your own folders. If it only had an interface as nice as calibre! I for example already have a big library, and can't risk to destroy the order that I have by importing everything into calibre. There is just too much risk involved, I don't want to experience what Loris did. My library contains many years worth of collecting and scanning thousands of documents, I am not going to trust any program to move them around and rename them. I often use google desktop search my files, and then look around in the same folder for related things. With calibre, this workflow would break. Another thing reason to keep books outside of the black box is that you may want to keep them together with other stuff, like the extras that came with the book. Thanks for your review. I totally agree btw. and think calibre is the best program out there for books. My annoyance is because I can't use it for my large existing library. cheers, dan Terafall November 6, 2012 at 7:04 pm Calibre is great.For me it's like vlc for ebooks Reply Jeremiah Iliffe October 28, 2012 at 8:09 am I've got to say I love Calibre.. use it for everything even though I have a kindle Reply Siddhant Chaurasia October 23, 2012 at 7:10 am Calibre has a really nice UI Reply Debbie Strain October 22, 2012 at 7:11 pm Very Interesting article. I am just now getting into ebooks and audible books. I am very old fashioned and like to read with a nice paperback however the digital age is catching up with me. I am currently using Mantano Reader Lite on my tablet and phone after reading a review here. I will be trying Calibre and hope it is easy to use. Reply Aaron Couch October 24, 2012 at 8:08 pm Debbie, Although Calibre can be an eBook reader, it probably doesn't excel at that as much as it does an eBook manager. Thanks for the comment! Reply Lisa Santika Onggrid October 22, 2012 at 1:18 pm Calibre is so good after you accept the fact that you'll not be able to sort your books in your own file structure. I agree that it's better Calibre's way, but my OCD has been keeping me away from the library folder. I can't stand the mess created, folder management-wise. Aside of my personal quirks, I do recommend it to anyone. It's very powerful once you've added plugins to suit your needs.
