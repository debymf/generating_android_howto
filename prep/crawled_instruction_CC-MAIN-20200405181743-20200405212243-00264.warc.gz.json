The whole point of those is to actually load the page in the background so that by the time you click on the page, it's fully loaded and ready to be read. Firefox beta merely adds the page to the browser. The loading happens after yo have switched to the browser. Which totally defeats the purpose. Maybe the feature is not complete yet. But as it stands, it's nor replacing LinkBubble and is pretty useless. Reply Anonymous October 3, 2015 at 1:10 pm I would suggest getting linkbubble especially since its now free.I suppose its somewhat like tab queuing. Not as suitable for a daily browser but defiantly worth having it //www.makeuseof.com/tag/link-bubble-review/ Reply Mihir Patkar October 3, 2015 at 3:51 pm Yup, it's exactly like Tab Queueing, but hey, you get a proper full-fledged browser with Firefox 42 and no floating app icon either!

It's a simple thing that can be so useful. Reply Mihir Patkar October 1, 2015 at 7:33 am I know, right? About damn time, Mozilla Reply Anonymous September 29, 2015 at 6:28 pm I've never found Chrome for Android to be a particularly compelling browser. Android actually has a lot of good browsing options and there's no One True Browser for it any more than there is on Windows or OSX. Android Chrome is somewhat crashy and seems to eat a lot of RAM. I also notice more rendering defects in it than on Firefox or Dolphin. The only real reason I keep it on most Android devices is that a certain percentage of mobile web developers entirely equate mobile browsing with Webkit a rendering engine and don't fail as gracefully as I might like. Fennec (Firefox for Android) has an image problem in that it doesn't have much in the way of marketing, doesn't ship as a default product on anything and the biggest reasons for using it amount to third party addons anyway. I think it's faster and less crashy, but I also wouldn't bother with that if not for Ad blocking and Ghostery support (and Flash, I guess. Maybe. For somebody). I don't know if it needs to have vastly wider adoption on Android, or if growth in Fennec usage would just lead to greater abandonment of developer work on the desktop Firefox product. I also know that I see more Mobile IE traffic than I see Fennec browser sessions in the logs on the web sites I manage. It's very much a niche product. In closing, all contemporary web browsers across all platforms are to some greater or lesser degree unsatisfactory and it is probably best to consider each of them as a tool for a particular set of needs rather than the be all and end all of web usage. Reply Mihir Patkar September 30, 2015 at 6:48 am Fennec actually had this feature for some time, but right now, FF seems to be doing better as an overall browser than Fennec. I tried Fennec for this review and was disappointed, compared to FF. Your thoughts? Reply Anonymous September 29, 2015 at 4:21 pm Ah, the good old tl;dr.
