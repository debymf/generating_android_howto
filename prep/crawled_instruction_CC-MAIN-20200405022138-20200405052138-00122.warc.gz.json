Chrome for iOS does have a reader view. If the page has a check mark on the reading list, tap on it without wifi on and it'll open in a reader view. Reply Akshata Shanbhag October 12, 2018 at 7:52 am Amber, that reader view is restricted only to webpages you have saved to Reading List. There doesn't seem to be a proper reader function that works across non-ReadingList webpages like Reader View in Safari does or Evernote Clearly and Readability used to.
