Script errors, especially errors indicating a script is taking too long to run, sometimes sort themselves out if you simply reload the web page. If the error doesn't reoccur, then you don't have to worry about it. If it continues to come back, there may be a problem with your web browser. To force a web page to reload on Windows: Hold Ctrl+F5 . To force a web page to reload on MacOS: Hold Command+Shift+R . Update your web browser. Outdated web browsers sometimes interact with scripts in unexpected ways that end up creating errors. Since it's a good idea to keep your web browser updated anyway, due to security concerns, this is one of the first fixes that you should try. Updating Google Chrome or Firefox is pretty straightforward. Try loading other web pages. This is an easy way to see if the problem is localized to a single website. If you see script errors on one website, then there's probably an issue with the scripts on that website, and there's nothing you can do about it. If you see script errors on a lot of websites, there's probably an issue with your web browser. Switch to a different web browser . This is another easy, yet important, step that can help narrow down the source of the problem. If the web page loads fine in a different browser, then there's some kind of problem with the first browser. You can change your default browser in Windows as well as on macOS . Try loading the web page with a different device. This is a good way to determine whether or not the problem is on your end or not. If you see a script error when you visit a web page on your computer, but you don't see it when you visit that page with your phone, a friend's computer, or another device, then the problem is on your end. If you see the same error on multiple devices, there is probably a problem with the website you're trying to visit. In that case, all you can do is wait for the webmaster to fix the problem. Remove temporary internet files . If you have corrupted internet cache files on your computer, you may end up seeing script errors. In most cases, simply clearing your web browser cache will fix this problem. Disable your plugins . When something goes wrong, it's possible for an unforeseen interaction between a plugin and a website to prevent a script from running properly. If your script error goes away after disabling your plugins, re-enable them one at a time to determine which plugin is causing the problem. You can either continue using the plugin and live with the script error, or stop using that plugin until the developer fixes the issue. Disable hardware acceleration. Hardware acceleration is a feature that allows your web browser to tap into the power of your video card. In some cases, having this feature turned on will break certain scripts. Turning it off allows those scripts to run normally. You can turn off hardware acceleration in Chrome and disable hardware acceleration in Firefox . Reset your browser security settings, or reset your browser. In some cases, abnormally high security settings in your web browser can interfere with scripts. If you don't have a specific reason to have your security set so high, you can try resetting the security level. If that doesn't work, you can also just reset your browser settings all at once. You can quickly reset Chrome to its default state, refresh Firefox , reset Microsoft Edge, and reset Safari . Wait for the webmaster. If you still encounter script errors after attempting all of these fixes, it's likely there's just a problem with a script on the website you're trying to use. This is especially likely if you only see the script error when you visit a specific website or websites. Since this is out of your control, you just have to wait for the webmaster of the website to fix the problem.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-fix-script-error-4689227", "index": 0}
