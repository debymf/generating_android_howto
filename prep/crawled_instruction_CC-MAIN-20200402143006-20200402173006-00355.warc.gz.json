Then tap Data usage . In the Data usage menu, tap the Cellular data setting to turn data usage off. Once you turn off Cellular data, you won't be able to access any websites or use any apps that use internet data. The only way to access the internet is by enabling Wi-Fi when you're near a Wi-Fi hotspot . You can enable this by going back to the main settings menu and tapping Wi-Fi. On the Wi-Fi screen, tap to enable Wi-Fi. Using Wi-Fi hot spots is a great way to avoid hitting your monthly cellular data limit. Thankfully, there are Wi-Fi hot spots available all around the world in convenient locations. Turning off cellular data also cuts down on the temptation to use your phone while you're driving. Finally, tap the Wi-Fi network you want to connect to and tap Connect to connect the phone to that Wi-Fi network. Once you're connected to a Wi-Fi hotspot, you can continue using the internet and any mobile apps that require internet data, even while you have cellular data turned off.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-turn-on-mobile-data-4685092", "index": 0}

On the Cellular screen, tap the Cellular Data toggle button to turn it on or off. With iOS, you can fine tune exactly what elements of cellular data are turned off. If you tap cellular data options , you'll see a menu where you can disable the use of LTE voice when you're in a roaming area. This is useful for when you're traveling internationally and don't want to incur roaming charges. Turning roaming off while traveling internationally is a very smart choice. International data roaming charges can be very expensive. And if you make the mistake of using an app like Google Maps while driving, the roaming charges can be surprisingly expensive. Just like with Android, manually disabling cellular data when you don't need it can save significantly in data overage charges. Instead, focus on visiting Wi-Fi hotspots whenever you want to access the internet or use apps that require internet data.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-turn-on-mobile-data-4685092", "index": 1}
