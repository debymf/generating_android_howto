That way Apple and IOS 9 can reject any liability and lawsuits - with words like \" it is your responsibility to \"keep your phone safe\" we can't be held responsible bla bla Interesting that is comes at a time where European Union a making passing a law making it possible for people to sue companies for privacy breach Could be interesting to know Reply Anonymous September 17, 2015 at 10:55 pm Just checked my Google Nexus Player but it says everything is up to date so no update needed. As for iOS 9, coming on the heels of the iOS 8 update, in the words of Waylon Smithers \"But she has a new hat!\"...in other words, so what? Nothing much changed for my daily use on my IPads. Might be different for you phone users but for me, it's business as usual... Reply Anonymous September 17, 2015 at 10:25 pm \"Android Passwords Are Rendered Useless\" ?? Who writes this click-bait crap. Seriously, it is only a small segment of the Google version of Android that is exposed (and there are a number of simple temporary fixes). It does not affect phones from Samsung and other manufacturers. Any chance someone could do a little homework before spouting off like Donald Trump. Reply Anonymous September 17, 2015 at 10:55 pm Now this is the article you could have written... http://www.wired.com/2015/09/hack-brief-new-emergency-number-hack-easily-bypasses-android-lock-screens/ \"The issue is limited to phones that use a password rather than a PIN or pattern. That s a small fraction of the millions of potentially vulnerable devices.\" or this one... http://www.androidheadlines.com/2015/09/bug-leaves-android-5-x-vulnerable-password-lock-screen-hack.html So rather than creating inappropriate potential hysteria, you could get your facts straight and actually provide some useful information. Reply Anonymous September 18, 2015 at 1:10 pm If you want to read an article from wired, read the damn article from wired, don't complain about a damn article that is not written to your specifications, this person could write whatever they wanted, they chose this so keep your trap shut if you have nothing good to say, or if your going to say \"you should have written it this way\" Reply Anonymous September 18, 2015 at 4:03 pm Geez Alex, maybe it's time to up the meds. I'll say what I want, when I want, any way I want. The article is incomplete and misleading. That's sloppy, click bait induced, journalism (and I use the term journalism loosely here). I don't have to (and won't) justify my response to you but thanks for letting me know at least one person read it. Good luck with detox. Reply Anonymous September 18, 2015 at 9:18 pm Cant up zero meds ;), plus your welcome on reading the comment, however here at makeuseof is seems more like these are articles written by people who just want to write and hope it helps someone. And you could use any article and say it is incomplete and misleading because usually people don't have all of the details or they might seem to be missing a couple of key things, thats why there is a link that goes to another article talking about ios 9 and all of its updates. Click Bait is not really what I would use for this article. It is however a good article that is quite useful and seems to be simple enough for an average person to read. Anonymous September 18, 2015 at 10:02 pm Again, you miss the point. Stating \"Your Android Password Is Useless \" is factually incorrect. Its highly emotional wording intent on drawing people into the article (based on FUD). Also, stating the Android has a password issue then spending the majority of the article on the benefits of iOS9 seems equally questionable. If I am an Android user, why would I care about anything iOS? No matter how you try and skew it, this is possibly the worst thought out article in MakeUseOfHistory. Don't get me wrong, I follow/read/enjoy MakeUseOf but I'll call a spade a spade regardless of who writes/posts it. Anonymous September 18, 2015 at 10:16 pm you should care about the fact that your android has a few security troubles that he tells you what they are. Anonymous September 18, 2015 at 10:26 pm I am experienced enough with IT (20+ yrs) to have already known about the issue. My concern is for the variety of less experienced people that come here (and those I have recommended this site to previously). Fact: It was poorly done, misleading and played on FUD I have come to expect better from MakeUseOf as a source. Dave Parrack September 18, 2015 at 10:32 pm Please read the actual section of the article you have an issue with (not the headline), and tell me what the problem is? I have told the truth, which is that a bug in Android 5.0 was discovered which allowed people to bypass password lock screens, informed readers what Google is doing about it, and then offered some advice, namely to switch to using a pattern or PIN until the issue is fixed. I stand by that as a solid tree paragraphs of informative reporting. Dave Parrack September 18, 2015 at 10:28 pm It's always nice to meet a fan! All I can advise is for you to either avoid Tech News Digest or even all articles written by me, but please don't abandon MakeUseOf because you disagree with one headline of one article written as part of a daily column. Dave Parrack September 18, 2015 at 10:26 pm Thanks for your support, Alex. The point of this article, and every edition of Tech News Digest, is to provide a brief overview of the current tech news, and I think we do it well. As you say, it's written for the average user, not someone who is already so technically minded that they have probably already seen all of this news reported elsewhere. Dave Parrack September 18, 2015 at 10:24 pm John, you're entitled to your view, but as the author of this article I disagree with your assessment. There's a huge difference between clickbait and an engrossing headline. Sure, I could have written a long headline such as \"Some Android Passwords on Certain Handsets Can Be Bypassed By Typing In a Long String of Characters\" but it would be wholly unnecessary. This headline tells you that there's a problem with Android passwords, and if you want to know more you should probably read the whole article. You have also taken issue with this article also talking about iOS 9. This is daily news digest, and as such it covers multiple news stories. One was the Android password problem, and another entirely different story was the launch of iOS 9. I don't know if you noticed but there are four other stories in there too. Our Security section may address the Android password issue in greater detail in the coming days, but that is not what this column does. Reply Anonymous September 18, 2015 at 10:33 pm Don't make it worse by being ridiculous. No editor worth his snuff would have allowed such a headline to begin with. That said, \"Android exploit, Is your device Affected\" or \"Some Android devices exposed by bug\" or something like that would have been far more accurate/appropriate. My apologies for the misquote, I was responding to the previous posters comment \"...because usually people don t have all of the details or they might seem to be missing a couple of key things, thats why there is a link that goes to another article talking about ios 9 and all of its updates.\" I stand by my assertion of Click bait however. You can fiddle with the semantics all you want but the \"urgency\" associated with \"Android Passwords Are Rendered Useless\" is far higher than something like \"Android exploit, Is your device Affected\" Reply Anonymous September 18, 2015 at 10:47 pm Well I am now opting out of this comment thread, I understand your point of view John I just choose not to accept it Anonymous September 17, 2015 at 4:26 pm Don't mean to seem like a clod here but did you really mean to refer to the Washington Post as an \"esteemed organ\"? Reply Anonymous September 17, 2015 at 5:45 pm @Sahate Ubiol, Organ is a valid but seldom used English-language synonym for newspaper or communiqu . I'd say there's usually a mildly negative connotation, since it's often indicate a source of bias, e.g. \"Pravda is the organ for the Russian Communist party.\" Reply Dave Parrack September 18, 2015 at 10:17 pm Oh yes, that was intended. I see now that it may be very British, and therefore not the best line to use on MakeUseOf, but it is at least proper English, as likefun butnot said :) Reply Anonymous September 17, 2015 at 1:26 pm Dave, you forgot to discuss the only feature of iOS 9 that is actually important: Proper letter case on the on-screen keyboard. I might even dig my iphone out from under my desk and take the time to update it, just so I can see it in person.
