Number 5 did the work for me. I tried so many things before but nothing was working. Reply MaryJean November 22, 2019 at 1:37 pm Ok, so I guess I am the only one who has run into this problem bc I can't find anything on the internet/youtube to address this. While taking a road trip my Nextbook Ares 11.6 tablet got plugged into the wrong cord. The cord it got plugged into was for my portable oxygen machine that is a much stronger output. Now the tablet won't boot up. I spoke to a programer friend and he suggested I remove the battery and allow it to drain but due to the copper tape on the back the best I could do was disconnect it. Has anyone removed a battery for one of these? Do you know where I could purchase the copper tape? I have another battery from a parts tablet just held up by the copper copper tape panel on the back side. I would welcome some fresh ideas as I have a lot of stuff on this tablet I would like to save. Reply noname November 17, 2019 at 5:22 pm What should I do if my phone charges but it wont just turn on?

When i put it on charging, there was no charging animation. After an hour in trying switching it on, nothing happened. Then I started searching internet and came across this site. The battery of tegra note is non removable and soldered directly on to mother board unlike nexus 7(1st gen), so removing battery was out of question. Then i tried pressing the power as recommended, nothing happened. neither did the recovery mode . So i opened the back panel and checked the battery voltage with multimeter, it showed 3.17V. Connected the usb charger and checked (with charger connected) , it showed the same voltage again. I then connected the tegra note battery with an external power supply(4.9V, 2A.. directly) and boosted the voltage till 3.3V.... connected the usb cable... charging animation is back... and device booted after 5 min ..

The second \"is\" was meant to be \"it\"......???? Reply Mary from Brooklyn January 17, 2014 at 2:33 pm Spell check is not the answer. Grammar check or possibly even proofreading it is. Reply DCR January 17, 2014 at 12:29 am Have had this happen with iPad touch, iPhone4 & iPhone5s... The apple devices seem to like to be sync'd via USB cable... This has worked to un-brick these apple devices.... The iPhone is excellent technology... Although I find the is to be old and limited... I do highly recommend is as a good smart phone for beginners.... Reply sweet52 January 16, 2014 at 11:33 pm Using the power button and volume works with my HP Slate 7 tablet. From there you can clean and then reboot,,, worked great for me, no more problems so far....:-) Reply Rob January 16, 2014 at 11:26 pm Asus TF300 - Happened once. Tried a lot of different combinations to get it to boot. I thought I was dead in the water. As per Asus online support ... long-press Volume Up + Power at the same time until screen comes on in a recovery mode. It took extra time for boot up but at least it worked! Reply John Smith January 16, 2014 at 8:02 pm Make use of the one year warranty from the manufacturer if that is still applicable, secondly I would be very careful in using third party to fix my item. Lastly, I never trust service providers warranty as they are useless. From experience.... Reply Iain McLaughlin January 16, 2014 at 6:24 pm My HTC one, completely froze after a full charge and no multi button hard reset method worked at all. Bizarrely what did bring it back to life was yet another 10 second plus power button hold and then placed the front face camera lens close up to a light bulb, whilst maintaining the button press and lo and behold it booted as normal within a couple of seconds of placing it on front of the bulb Reply Anonymous January 16, 2014 at 8:43 pm Cool Reply Nerds 2 You January 16, 2014 at 5:51 pm I've had a couple Android phones that had a broken power button (my own doing from tinkering inside) and I was always able to power them on by plugging them in to power while holding one of the volume buttons down. I have had more than a few friends with an iPhone that had a broken power button and they also power on once plugged in. Reply Andy January 16, 2014 at 2:48 pm It doesn't turn on because its Android... This wouldn't happen on an iPhone Reply Gavin R January 16, 2014 at 3:57 pm Hmmm, maybe my iPhone had Android inside? Reply Tomi Jankulovski January 16, 2014 at 2:46 pm I had this problem with Samsung Galaxy S. It wouldn't boot even after I performed factory reset. I solved the problem by using \"Heimdall - Open-Source Cross-Platform Flashing Suite\" to reinstall the ROM. After that the device worked just fine. Reply Sharon H January 16, 2014 at 2:42 pm I agree with Tom E. My Samsung was doing the samething and I opened it up and under the inner power button was one piece of cat hair. Blowing that out did the trick. Until I did this I had to plug it into the charger to get it to turn on which only works if you're near the charger when your phone rings. Reply Min Xuan X January 16, 2014 at 6:24 am What if the power button is broken? Reply Kitty K January 16, 2014 at 8:32 am Same question... Reply Tom E January 16, 2014 at 12:46 pm My last phone had a power button that pushed, but did nothing. I opened the phone up, and the power button was moved, due to dust and pocket lint. A little cleaning and it worked! Getting the phone open (Samsung Galaxy S 2) was not trivial, but just look for instructions -- someone else HAS to have opened one up and posted instructions online.

Reply SheemOn January 16, 2014 at 7:11 am Sure. Anything Apple sells is inhumanly perfect. Somehow the same technology, same parts, but no crashes, ever. I have a bridge for sale, excellent location, excellent condition. Best offer. Reply Mohamed Zahran January 16, 2014 at 9:54 am NO. Android devices leads the market with more than 60% that because of many advantages of android than any other OS including iPhone. I like my 2 in one phablet ASUS FONEPAD it works perfectly. Reply mandroid February 6, 2014 at 2:07 pm The iPhone has a common and, well known issue of the power button breaking.....long live the Android!

After it was returned it has worked OK. Reply hoykg January 15, 2014 at 9:13 pm I experienced this with my nexus5 twice in a month. The first time it was sort of scary. Then you type \"my nexus5 won't turn on or charge\" on google and you find many people with the same issue. The vol button up and down and then power button trick fixed it each time. A *decent* device is not supposed to do this though. I'm surprised to see on the internet so many people being \"Ok\" with it. Just because there is an easy fix or doesn't occur everyday doesn't make it \"OK\" imho. Reply jonen560ti January 15, 2014 at 10:21 pm i guess people dont want to look like they made a bad purchase so they defend their products no matter what. Reply samiya May 2, 2014 at 9:14 pm that happened to me Reply cynflux January 15, 2014 at 8:25 pm I experience this issue with an Asus MemoPad HD7, usually when the device goes into sleep mode. The only way to restart the device is to plug into the wall outlet and then press the power button. Some forums called it the 'sleep of death' and apparently it is common.

I used my brothers charger yesterday and it didn't work so today i used my brother's charger and i did this method Hold Volume Up + Volume Down + Power. and its working and charging perfectly :) Thank you so much Reply JJ January 23, 2017 at 9:24 pm I got given a GoClever Terra 7oL as an out-of-the-blue gift, but since it was coming up to Christmas I stopped using it hoping I was getting a better tablet. I didn't get a new tablet, so I went home trying to turn on my GoClever. It wouldn't turn on so I thought the battery drained as it does. I plugged it in, but after about 10 mins of charging still nothing where it usually shows me the battery logo. I tried Hard Reset method but still nothing. Please someone help me as this is the only tablet I've got with up to date software ?? Reply", "url": "https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/android-phone-tablet-turn/", "index": 1}
