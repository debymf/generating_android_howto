The Launch App function in the store doesn't do anything and neither does the icon in Google App Launcher. Reply Hobosic March 22, 2009 at 3:56 am Hi, Can i take a one small picture from your site? Have a nice day Hobosic Reply Guy McDowell March 10, 2009 at 8:55 am I can definitely see applications for this in the business world - especially my industry. I think you are correct that if you have a netbook with a basic set of drivers that hooks to something like Cloudo or Ghost on startup. Good find Stefan. Good writing too! Reply Stefan Neagu March 10, 2009 at 12:11 pm Thanks Guy! Reply Thomas March 9, 2009 at 4:16 pm Does anyone think of privacy concern? I like the concept and usability behind cloud computing but I can not get read of an idea this would be a perfect place for owners to see our files. Much the same like Google does with our email. I would probably never store something valuable up there. So can cloud be the future? Welcome Reply Stefan Neagu March 10, 2009 at 12:57 am You, me and John C. Dvorak; Yes we all think about privacy: that's why I have a password for the smartcard which contains the password to my master password database. All my passwords are usually 12-32 characters HEX or ASCII for bank and PayPal. Which also means that I don't actually know my Google account password - just the key to unlock it. The point is, that if you're careful, and you don't put your SSN up there, you'll probably be fine. Reply Stefan Neagu March 9, 2009 at 11:28 am I'll try Ghost and report back. Reply Eric Honaker March 9, 2009 at 8:42 am This looks interesting. As for the privacy concern, how easy is it to save your documents to a local USB key drive? I would not worry very much about online documents if I never have to leave them there. Google Docs could use that feature, actually. Reply Stefan Neagu March 10, 2009 at 1:01 am You can't save files to your computer as far as I know. Reply Aibek March 9, 2009 at 6:15 am another test! Reply Aibek March 9, 2009 at 5:26 am test! Reply Sameep March 9, 2009 at 2:53 am eyeOS is also a great offering . It's been around way longer. Reply Stefan Neagu March 10, 2009 at 12:46 am A great find Sameep! Thanks, I'm going to review that in a later article. Reply Francis Simisim March 8, 2009 at 11:58 pm Nice cloud OS, but I wonder if people will really go for it with the recent news on Google private docs leaking to the public. It could be used for non-work materials but probably not for work stuff, what do you think? TechFilipino Reply Stefan Neagu March 9, 2009 at 12:54 am Privacy is a very important issue. I agree that many are not prepared to trust a third party with their sensitive documents. Reply Rohan Jayasekera March 8, 2009 at 11:45 pm If the 20-year-olds are already spending more than 95% of their computer time online, just wait a little longer and it will be 100%, thanks to Google Docs, Picnik, etc. There is no further need for the \"desktop\" metaphor, especially when it doesn't work on the mobile devices where the future mostly lies. Yet Cloudo uses the desktop approach. It doesn't move away from the \"set of ideas and concepts that were developed in the late 70 s\"; it tries to preserve it. Incidentally, Cloudo-like products are already available elsewhere. But they're smart enough to reproduce a familiar environment like Windows or KDE rather than creating a new one. Reply Stefan Neagu March 9, 2009 at 12:52 am A great comment, Rohan Jayasekera; I think Cloudo will be the Windows Explorer or Finder in this scheme; it will have your files and let you do simple tasks with them. Reply Rohan Jayasekera March 9, 2009 at 11:27 am I think user-managed files are slowly going away. Files are now automatically managed by the application, e.g. Google Docs and wikis manage their own documents, Flickr manages its photo files, etc. And nobody uses files on their mobiles. (To see a future laptop/netbook, imagine a smartphone of today but with a bigger screen and keyboard.) For those who do insist on managing their own files, a virtual computer like Cloudo is unnecessary. An online drive is sufficient. There are lots of online drives, e.g. Box.net, and for years there have been rumours that Google will introduce a \"Gdrive\", the latest rumour being here). And files stored on Box.net can be accessed from an iPhone or BlackBerry, which I imagine is not true of Cloudo. Reply Stefan Neagu March 10, 2009 at 12:51 am Isn't the point to be able to do stuff like view videos, write, save files, etc without leaving the CloudOS? The whole workflow inside the Cloud OS. Not having to jump from a site to another; I can't view Box.net files in Google Docs, for example. Rohan Jayasekera March 10, 2009 at 2:37 am There is no need for files at all if you just use web-based applications like Google Docs. But if you insist on managing your own set of files: How are you going to run anything other than a simple application? Cloudo cannot run Microsoft Office or OpenOffice; it can't run Photoshop or anything like it. Third-party developers won't port their apps to a platform that doesn't have a large number of users. A remote virtual desktop like Cloudo needs to give the user an established operating environment like Windows or Linux, so that apps like Microsoft Office can be used. (I have no particular interest in remote virtual desktops but I know that some products already exist, e.g. VMware View provides access to a Windows desktop that actually runs on a server.) Stefan Neagu March 10, 2009 at 12:15 pm Won't that happen gradually, in time, as more applications are developed and more users sign up? Guy Cross March 9, 2009 at 2:44 am sleepywhisper.com/index.php/2009/03/cloud-computing-in-the-small-business-environment/ Just posted a similat (but not quite as good LOL) post on my blog, click the link above to have a look. Guy Reply Stefan Neagu March 10, 2009 at 12:39 am You have a couple of good points in there. Keep it up! Reply Curbob March 8, 2009 at 9:10 pm This type of CloudOS will be useful if I can boot my computer and it doesn't boot anyother OS but just connects wirelessly and I run the CloudOS without using another OS. (I know you need some type of OS to have wireless drivers and such to connect to \"the cloud\") but till we can do that, why would someone want an desktop OS within their OS they're already running? Reply Stefan Neagu March 9, 2009 at 12:49 am In the future I think you'll have a basic set of drivers for your computer - the apps and files will be all online. Reply Aaron March 8, 2009 at 8:43 pm Too bad you need an OS and a browser to use it. BTW, right-click the desktop and you'll see \"New Solution\" as an option. WTF does that mean?? Reply matt March 9, 2009 at 8:03 am its a development tool, for makin scripts or small applications. pretty slick actually. Reply Wez Pyke March 8, 2009 at 7:42 pm Looks good I'll give it a try. Reply Stefan Neagu March 9, 2009 at 12:47 am Don't forget to come back and tell us what you think about it. Reply Gusto March 8, 2009 at 7:12 pm This is awesome. Imagine this with support for an IDE in the cloud Reply Stefan Neagu March 9, 2009 at 12:43 am There is a limited IDE integrated: Dev-Tool. Unfortunately it's nothing more than a Notepad with added syntax checking. Reply", "url": "https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/cloudo-your-entire-operating-system-in-the-cloud/", "index": 0}
