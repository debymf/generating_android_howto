Tap Select at the top right. If you're using iOS 6 or older, select the box with the arrow. Tap each image you want to share or print. Touch the box-and-arrow icon at the bottom, or Share if you're using an old version of iOS. Select an option from the menu. For example, Mail will open the picture(s) in the default Mail app so that you can email the photos. Message or Twitter imports the picture there so that you can text it or make a Tweet from it. Print is available here, too, letting you print the photos directly from your iPhone. Copy makes pasting the image into a different app easy. AirPlay transfers wirelessly among Apple devices. Use that app to complete the photo share.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/print-share-delete-photos-in-iphone-photos-app-4103844", "index": 0}

In the top bar, you will see that iOS has three available protocols: L2TP, PPTP, and IPSec. If your VPN is provided by an employer, then they will most likely inform you as to which protocol to use. If you are using your own hosted VPN, however, then be sure to use a form which is supported by your provider. Image titled Connect to a VPN Step 39 4 Enter a description. This could be anything you want. For instance, if this is a work VPN, then you could describe it as \"Work.\" If you plan to use this VPN for watching an out-of-country Netflix, then you could call it \"Canadian Netflix.\" Image titled Connect to a VPN Step 40 5 Enter your server information. This information should have been given to you either by your VPN provider or your employer. Image titled Connect to a VPN Step 41 6 Enter your \"Account\" name. This field refers to your username which you most likely created when purchasing your hosted VPN or was created for you by an employer. Image titled Connect to a VPN Step 42 7 Turn on \"RSA SecurID\" if you use this form of authentication. To turn this on, tap on the gray button. When it turns green, this feature is turned on. RSA SecureID comprises either a hardware or software mechanism which produces keys to verify a user over periods of time. Most likely, you will only have RSA SecurID in a professional setting. To turn on RSA SecurID in IPSec, tap on the button for \"Use Certificate\" so it turns green. After choosing \"RSA SecurID,\" click \"Save.\" IPSec will also allow you to use CRYPTOCard, or any certificates in the raw formats .cer, .crt, .der, .p12, and .pfx . Image titled Connect to a VPN Step 43 8 Enter your \"Password. \" Your password was most likely provided at the same time as your username. Consult with your employer or VPN provider if you do not have this information. Image titled Connect to a VPN Step 44 9 Enter your shared \"Secret\" if you require it. A \"secret\" is used to further authenticate your account. Much like the \"key\" of an RSA Secure ID, the \"secret\" is typically a series of letters and numbers given to you by a provider or employer. If it has not been provided to you then you either may not need to enter anything in that field or you may need to contact your provider or employer in order to obtain the secret. Image titled Connect to a VPN Step 45 10 Enter the \"Group Name\" for an IPSec connection if needed. Again, this would be given to you, so if your employer or provider have shared this information with you then enter it in this field. If they haven't, then, most likely, you may leave the field blank. Image titled Connect to a VPN Step 46 11 Choose whether to \"Send All Traffic\" to the VPN. Click the button next to this field and ensure it is highlighted in green if you want all your internet traffic to go through the VPN. Image titled Connect to a VPN Step 47 12 Click \"Save\" in the top right corner to save your settings. At this point, your VPN is connected. You may turn your VPN connection on or off from the main \"Settings\" page by clicking its corresponding button. If the button is green, then you are connected. If the button is gray, then you are not connected. It will appear directly underneath \"Wi-Fi.\" Also, when your phone is using the VPN connection, an icon will appear in the upper left-hand side of your phone consisting of the capital letters \"VPN\" inside a box.
