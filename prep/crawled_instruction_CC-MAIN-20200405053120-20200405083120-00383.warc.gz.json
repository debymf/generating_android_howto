Very helpful to know that is possible to use ibooks to listen to audiobooks! Anyway, a limitation I noticed with using ibooks for audibooks is that although automatically saves the latest place in the book I had listened, it inot possible using ibooks to save multiple bookmarks of the same book that one can save when is listening to one audiobook and likes to get back to specific places or segments of that book (for instance to listen it again or write a quote one likes). Basically, i'm looking for the feature that ibooks have for books, but I see is missing for audiobooks. Does Bound has this feature that enables to save several bookmarks of the same book one is listening to? Reply Annette January 28, 2019 at 3:10 pm Seriously!!??? Where has this info been all my life? I've been listening to audiobooks in iTunes and having to scrubber my way back to the place I left off for....YEARS!!!! I hated stopping a book and I would leave it open on my ipod so I wouldn't lose my place. I knew there must be a better way or an app of some kind and that's when I landed here. THANKS THANKS THANKS. Reply Listening September 13, 2018 at 5:54 am OMG, Thank YOU! I love Hay House audiobooks, but they only have a super basic player on their website. They do allow downloads of purchased material, but I couldn't get iTunes to work (I do almost all of my computing on my phone and don't sync it to my laptop so didn't want to have to start now). Bookmobile is working perfectly so far. Sure I have to use the laptop to get the book onto my phone, but I don't have to deal with all the hassle of iOS trying to sync everything just to be able to listen to a book. I've been listening to the book in Files and trying to remember where I left off each time... Ugh. Thank you! Reply JB July 9, 2018 at 4:30 am Hi: I am looking for an alternative to ibooks. All the apps I've tried so far don't access the audiobooks (mp3) files that I load using 3rd party software. ibooks finds the files for playing OK, but sometimes looses my place after ending & restarting the app. Not always, just sometimes then making it a hassle to find where I left off. Any suggestions will be appreciated. JB Reply James December 2, 2017 at 5:10 pm I used iBooks for a long time, but keeping all the metadata correct and making sure iBooks was happy was too much of a pain. So I got Bookmobile and was a big fan of that for a while. But loading up books was still a pain. Zipping up a directory of mp3s made things easier to transfer but it was still just too many steps for me. I just recently got Bound and love that is (just recently got the feature) connects to my OneDrive account. The only thing I wish it would do it start in a directory of my choosing and sync location across devices. But it is SO much easier to load books now. Reply Kenny September 23, 2017 at 12:46 pm To get the default music player to remember or bookmark your place, you must perform the following steps. 1. Use MediaMonkey or some tool to make sure all of the metadata is the same for all of the tracks. Otherwise, iTunes may not know they need to stay together. 2. Drag the files into iTunes, go to Music to find them, select them all, right click and select Get Info and mark that the files are a Compilation (checkbox). 3. Go to options in iTunes and select to Remember Playback Position and CLICK OK (do not select the media kind to audiobook until after clicking OK - next step). 4. With files selected, right click and select Get Info again, go to OPTIONS and change the media kind to AUDIOBOOK. Now, you can use the built-in player if you like. What I have found over the years is that Apple will eventually make every audiobook application you love not work with some software update, so you might as well use theirs. Reply Jan August 17, 2017 at 7:29 am How do you access other Libraries Overdrive audiobooks if you don't have a library card for that library? I use the Overdrive app for my library and my daughter shares her library card with me for hers. But I don't know how to say access a library in Ohio if I'm in Maryland. Would really appreciate any help I can get. My library will get trilogies where book 1 and 3 are audiobooks but book 2 will be an ebook so I can end up buying it. Thank you all I n advance for your time and help! Have A Great Day! Jan Reply Shabby August 3, 2017 at 11:14 pm Thank you for sharing how to put audiobooks in iTunes (to sync to my iPhone)! I've been figuring that out.
