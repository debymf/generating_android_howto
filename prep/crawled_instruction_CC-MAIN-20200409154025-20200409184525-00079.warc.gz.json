You don t need the login or account of the existing Google Home user who first set up the device. Just make sure you are connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the Google Home. Open up the app, skip the search for the device, and just log in with your Gmail account. You should see all Google devices that are connected to your Wi-Fi, including your Google Home device. Tap Link to my account under the Google Home icon to get started. The app will prompt you to say Ok Google and Hey Google twice each to recognize your voice. Once it s set up, you can ask, Ok Google, what s my name? to verify that it s set up correctly.", "url": "https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/set-up-multiple-users-google-home/", "index": 0}
