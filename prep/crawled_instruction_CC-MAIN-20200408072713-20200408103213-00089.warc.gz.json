I noticed the Google Play Services app had become VERY fat (over 66Mb from 1.5Mb) so within Settings> Applications> Manage Applications> All , I found the Google Play Services app, selected, and uninstalled the updates. After applying same to Google Services Framework, over 80Mb of memory was clawed back! Reply aj May 18, 2015 at 9:25 am I Hi I have a same problem runnngout storage space what can I do to fix.

Can't you please help this woman before her sanity leaves the building Reply Penny December 31, 2014 at 2:01 am Tried downloading the sd maid app... however, it tells me that there's not enough room!!! So catch 22, how can I free up space? I've moved what I can ie. music, pictures, etc to the sd card, but apps taking up majority of the room. & I'm sure there's stuff taking up room which can be cleaned up which I can't see.... how to do this without an app?? Reply Anonymous November 4, 2012 at 1:11 am Try not to add to many apps. Get rid of unused ones too. When i get a little more familiar with it I will try other things!

No Way Out Reply Scott July 15, 2012 at 5:25 pm Erez, what version of Android are you using? On mine (LG Optimus with Virgin Mobile) when I tap on \"Settings\" I do not see the same \"Storage\" option you displayed. Mine says \"SD Card and Phone Storage\", then when I choose that I am only shown how much storage each area is using. Tapping on them does not show the more detailed breakdown in your screenshot or open a file manager. I truly wish my Android had a built in way of showing exactly what is using up all my space... I am always getting \"low memory\" settings. Right now it says my available internal space is just 38mb. Anyhow, you should probably update your article to clarify which version of Android has the built in Storage setting and file manager you write about since apparently not all have it. Reply Erez Zukerman July 15, 2012 at 5:45 pm Hi Scott, I use Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich). If you do not have this option in your ROM, it is probably because your carrier disabled it for some reason. Android fragmentation is a huge issue, and this is an implicit disclaimer in all Android posts: Not all phones will have the same options, ever. Sad, but true. Reply alson January 3, 2013 at 7:30 am the thing is my storage shows 7 gb available on the sd card and when i open application in setings it just shows that 5.5 gb used and thats the limit it gives..whats happening to the rest of the 2 gb thats still free Reply Bumferry July 13, 2012 at 9:29 am I use app2SD which allows me utilise the little amount of storage available on my xperia arc S. easy to see what uses the most memory and the cache as well as moving apps from internal storage to the SD card where optional. It also lets you know what aspects of the app (widgets and the like) might not work if they are moved. it takes up very little space and has allowed me to utilise a lot of space on my phone and speed it up no end in the process. For a free app, its been a life saver. Reply Mac July 13, 2012 at 3:14 am I'm using Link2SD with a partitioned SD card. Simple and very effective!
