For caller ID spoofing and neighbor spoofing, the main thing to remember is to avoid answering phone calls from numbers you don't recognize. If you do happen to pick up, don't answer any questions or press any buttons if prompted either. Just hang up. Avoid suspicious links . To avoid DNS Spoofing, don't click suspicious links in emails or on banner ads on sketchy websites. Kaspersky also recommends users regularly scan their computers for malware. Verify the email . With email spoofing, verify the legitimacy of the email before interacting with it. Does the email address look familiar or correct? Does the message have typos and grammar mistakes? If the message seems suspicious, but appears to be from a friend or family member, reach out to that person or company to verify they're the ones who sent the message.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-spoofing-how-to-protect-yourself-4769020", "index": 0}
