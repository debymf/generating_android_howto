Once you click on \"Send\", what do you want to happen? I know of no email program or service that will ordinarily say \"are you sure you want to send this message\" at this stage. There are programs, extensions etc which will check for specific potential errors (such as \"you mentioned 'attachments' in your message, did you forget to send them\") but that doesn't sound quite like what you are after. Drsunil V September 29, 2013 at 5:37 pm This feature is in mobile gmail app settings. But question is for web interface for desktop Oron J September 30, 2013 at 8:54 am Ah, this makes sense. On a mobile, it's easy to touch the send button by mistake, hence this safety feature. On a desktop, it's assumed that when you click a button you mean it, except for very specific situations (replacing a file, for example), which is why mail clients don't have this feature. If anyone knows of such a feature in GMail or indeed in mail clients, I'd also be very interested to hear about it!", "url": "https://www.makeuseof.com/answers/how-to-enable-double-check-send-dialog-box-before-sending-a-composed-gmail/", "index": 0}
