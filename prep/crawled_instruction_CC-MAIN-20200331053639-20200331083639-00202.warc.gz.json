Dalsan M September 28, 2013 at 4:07 pm What methods have you tried, if any, to update your phone? I would try over-the-air updating first. Go to Settings, About Phone, and click on Software Updates (or something similar). If no updates are available, then try Kies: www?.samsung.com/in/kies/, http://www.samsung.com/us/kies/ , or whichever site version for your region. Install and run Kies. If it does not automatically check and say that there is an update for your phone, look at the options and manually check for updates. If there is an update, follow the instructions it gives. If no update was found, then try Hovsep's suggestion (you need Kies anyways because it will install the necessary drivers for your phone).
