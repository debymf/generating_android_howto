After a few moments, a window pops up from the bottom of the screen to start the set-up process. Tap Set Up . Next, select the room that the HomePod will be used in. This doesn't really change how the HomePod works, but it will influence where you find its settings in the Home app. After selecting a room, tap Continue . After that, determine how you want HomePod to be used on the Personal Requests screen. This controls who can make voice commands sending texts , creating reminders and notes , make calls, and more using the HomePod and the iPhone you're using to set it up. Tap Enable Personal Requests to allow anyone to do that or Not Now to restrict those commands just to you. Confirm that selection by tapping Use This iPhone in the next window.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/homepod-setup-use-4158729", "index": 0}
