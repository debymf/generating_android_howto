Reply Dr. Michael Ecker August 18, 2019 at 2:02 am Article ignores the fact that some Windows 7 copying is superior. Example: Copying a single file to a destination that has a file with the same name. In Win 10, you have to click again for more information to help you decide about whether to replace or not. In Windows 7, you see right away the file information, including the dates, without having to click again. Insofar as many users, myself included, most often copy a single file, I consider this a great advantage of Windows 7 and a HUGE deficiency of Windows 10. Simplistic articles that portray things just one way are not as great a service as the author or publisher may think. Come on! Give us pros AND cons. Reply Me December 18, 2019 at 10:48 pm I find that using the programme Everything that transfers are instantaneous. If there is a duplicate name in target directory it informs and you make the decision to copy or not. If you don't change the name it puts a suffix on the transferring file... eg. 1 or (1) etc. Leaves Teracopy for dead. Totally in my experience. Reply Me February 6, 2020 at 5:41 pm I agree completely Dr., Windows 7 was much faster copy files. By the time click all the windows and Windows 10's stupid little graph comes up Windows 7 would have copied the files already.

And when I came back in in the morning it was paused at 10 percent with a \"file is locked\" dialog. Now it is saying I have 6 hours left. I should have skipped the node modules folder. :/ Win 10 Enterprise 1803 Reply Warren Warshaw June 28, 2019 at 3:01 pm Stephen - interesting. I used to use Ycopy with Windows 7 to avoid the dreaded Windows file copy stopping if there was a problem. I just read in this article that Win 8 & 10 supposedly fixed this, but now you're saying it's still a problem. I wouldn't be a bit surprised it this was true (disappointed, but not surprised). Reply Cog I Tate December 13, 2018 at 11:00 pm I just did a 62GB/25,000 file copy from a QNAS NAS server (TS-231P2-4G) and Windows 10 1803 copy blew away robocopy. Same machine, connected on a 1GB local hardwire (Cat6) network. both were mapped to the source files using \\\\\\, target was the local C:\\ drive Robocopy ran for 3 hours and failed Windows drag and drop between two explorer windows (source dragged to target) and finished in under 30 minutes.

Windows does not provide multi threaded transfer nor do your softwares listed here! I was looking for a multi threaded file transfer software, then my friend suggested me to try GS Richcopy 360. I have been using it for an year now and yet no complains at all. It solved majority of my problems like long path name error, provides fast transfer speed and is easy to use. Try it, it never disappoints! Reply Sophia Jason May 27, 2017 at 9:39 am I have used many of the software available in the market using robocopy, terracopy, shadow copy and what not. But none of them provided me the proper and exact solution for copying huge files, until I found GS Richcopy. This software is just awesome, it provided me all the features that I wanted plus it had many extra features too. It provided me long path name support which is necessary when copying huge files, copying locked files, multi threaded file transfer for fast transfer speed, pre scheduled file transfer and many others. Try it, it never disappoints! Reply Mia lee May 16, 2017 at 6:24 pm Nice article but I would like to suggest you a really simple method. Just use GS Richcopy 360, I have been using it for almost an year. I'm very relaxed because of it, it is multi threaded so it can copy files faster than other file copying software. Not only that, I can even schedule my files for copying. It sends me an email when the transfer is done. Its amazing, all in one software by Guru Squad. Try it, hope it helps you all too! Reply Colinsh Maye May 3, 2017 at 6:08 pm Nice article which told me 4 ways to copy files faster in windows, I would like to tell you 1 more way which I have been using for almost 2 years. That's GS Richcopy 360, this software is a masterpiece of how software can be simple to use and yet very powerful. This is a highly recommended software for my side( and my colleagues too). When it comes to copying files faster this software has multi threaded file transfer which makes file transfer super fast. Try it, hope this helps! Reply Anurash Sinh April 23, 2017 at 12:04 pm Few years ago when I asked this question there were not many solutions but now it has many. To completely solve this problem I found a software GS RichCopy 360 which made my life easy and I am still using it. I have suggested this to my colleagues also, it's really aweosme. Hope it helps! Reply Alanah Frank April 13, 2017 at 9:39 am Forget teracopy I have used it earlier and it does not provide long path names. When it comes to copying loads of file you need that feature. After searching a lot I found that GS RichCopy 360 provides that. It is simple to use and it uses multi threading file transfer to speed up the process. I would recommend it to you all. Reply anon February 8, 2018 at 5:43 am Teracopy has had long filenames for many years. Version 2.3 is highly recommended. However, for the moment I advise staying away from version 3. v3 has issues copying over networks: the speed fluctuates wildly when copying large files, and when copying groups of files, it sometimes stalls for unknown reason, and sometimes also triggers Explorer to rescan the remote directory before it can resume. Reply ArKay February 11, 2017 at 12:35 pm I am currently moving data from a 5TB HDD to a bigger 8TB version and I've been at it FOR DAYS now. I have tried a few programs and most of them suck for that task. As long as those programs are writing to the Windows cache you achieve the 100MB/sec and up, but once the drive has to start empyting that cache to the disk, the copy operation comes down to a crawl (since it has to wait until the buffer has been emptied) and the transfer rate goes down to a few MB/sec. So up and down it goes all the time giving me an AVERAGE transfer rate of 20-30MB/sec. Even if I disable the cache in Windows it doesn't get faster, rather slower which is pretty odd. I am now using FastCopy for my task. I have been running it for the last 14 minutes and the transfer rate has been constantly somewhere between 100 and 108MB/sec. I think it doesn't use the Windows drive/write behind cache but does its own caching. In those 14 minutes I have copied 90GB. With any of the other tools I have tried it would have been 25GB at best. Reply Aaditya Singhania February 8, 2017 at 6:16 pm Obviously TeraCopy is a popular option among fast copying software, but I am highly disappointed with few problems, clashes and data loss while using this. So I would suggest to use GS RichCopy 360 for the job to be done smoothly. Hope this helped. Reply IronHand October 8, 2016 at 10:29 am It's no secret that Teracopy is quite popular when it comes to software copying. I've been a user myself, but has now been inconvenienced by several crashes/errors when transferring files. I had to do it all over again and it's really not worth for a busy individual like me. My friends suggested GS RIchCopy 360, and for several months it has been working perfectly fine for me. You might want to give it a try if you are looking for a reliable software. Hope this helped.

Doesn't have some of Teracopy's nice features (replacing explorer copy, and pausing/resuming), but it is faster.

Reply Omstavan S July 22, 2013 at 7:13 am When using teracopy, if you happen to copy a folder containing a lot of small files, you can clearly see that the copy speed is significantly slower as compared to windows.(only when large no. of small files) Reply Jonam July 22, 2013 at 4:13 am Windows 8 already transfers files faster than any previous versions of Windows. I never understood why replace Windows Explorer, it does exact same thing as any other alternative. Reply Bam July 19, 2013 at 1:46 am I was amazed at how fast Windows 8 copies files. Pulling files off my NAS jumped to 70-80MB/s from around 35MB/s on WinXP using Teracopy. If only they'd implemented an option for queued copying like Teracopy it would have been perfect, or at the very least when pausing a file transfer in the list, have an option for the next one to automatically resume when the previous has finished. Reply 210cab8f86b89110173d345767daac0f July 18, 2013 at 5:28 pm i have been using TeraCopy for two years, but it wasnt 100% reliable, then i swtched to FastCopy, which wasnt that practical, so i tried Ultra/Super Copier and kept it. TeraCopy has nice user interface and that probably kept me using it, but it isn't reliable as others, because when you migrate hundreds of thousands files to external drive you will put priority on reliability ;) Reply Chris Reddy July 18, 2013 at 4:55 pm Last year I benchmarked 14 file copy utilities (including Windows 7 File Copy) for both small and large files and found that FastCopy was hands down the best file copy utility in terms of speed, reliability, logging, repeatability, and integration.

Reply Vishal S July 18, 2013 at 12:05 pm After reading it, I decided to try it out myself. I copied a 2.04 GB file containing 3 MP4 files of movies from my Movies folder to it's parent folder (D:/) using 3 methods- 1. Normal Mouse based copy paste. 2. Keyboard shortcuts. 3. My own entry, the cygwin terminal. Time for copy was measured using a stopwatch app on my Android smartphone. For 1 and 2, the time was 1 minute and 1 second while from the cygwin terminal with cp -r command, it was 51 seconds. However, I couldn't remove the files using Windows (as Windows gave me errors) after copy from Cygwin and had to use it again to remove it Reply Joaquim Fonseca July 18, 2013 at 9:39 am Sometimes you can have errors related with name/path too long.

Reply Esaure July 19, 2013 at 1:38 am When i do a copy in windows 7 by drag&drop, 1 KB file shouldn't be noticed, taking a minute i would not call it \"greatly improved\", 1 GB file copy shouldn't take over ten seconds to start its copy, in windows 7 takes (up to 30) minutes to \"analize\".

Reply Doc July 20, 2013 at 10:48 pm If copying a file by drag & drop takes a minute on your PC, and if something is being \"analized\" (lol!) for up to 30 minutes, there's something wrong with your PC or network. As far as Windows 8, I'm avoiding it like the plague because of its ugly, flat theme and the \"Metro\" interface just plain sucks. I've been using Windows since the Windows 3.11 days, and, for the most part, Windows 7 is the best yet. DosGuy September 11, 2013 at 3:49 pm I still prefer the Dos 6.22 user interface, best OS ever. Reply Howard B July 17, 2013 at 11:10 pm \"Upgrade to Windows 8\" I'll do that when the Metro interface can be turned off for good, and it has a theme that doesn't look like crud (say, a Windows 7 theme). Until then, there's TeraCopy. Reply Wepiha T July 18, 2013 at 8:32 am \"It has a theme that doesn t look like crud (say, a Windows 7 theme).\" Well spoken, I too think the Windows 7 theme is crud but that's just like, my opinion, man. I rarely see the Metro interface (start8), except for the occasional pop-in from the side when I want to connect to a wireless network - how is that different from modern operating systems like say, Android? Which is to say a lot more convenient than a window that blocks my workflow. Metro is fine in small doses and actually useful, but there goes my opinion (again). TeraCopy is fantastic regardless! Reply Howard B July 19, 2013 at 12:03 am The Windows 7 theme is a vast improvement over, say, the Windows 3.11 visual style; I prefer Windows 7 (black) theme to the Windows XP theme (which was an improvement over 95/98/ME), and I install Vishal Gupta's VistaVG Black theme on new XP machines I'm going to use. (I like the window control buttons better on 7, as well as the ability to set black titlebars). At least the window control buttons are on the correct side...I can no longer say that about Ubuntu! Reply Chris Hoffman July 31, 2013 at 1:23 am I'm still using Windows 7 myself, but I have to give Windows 8 a hat-tip for the great improvement.
