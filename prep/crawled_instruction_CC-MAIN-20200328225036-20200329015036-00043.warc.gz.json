What phones don't overheat a lot? Reply Chandler July 10, 2018 at 8:44 am I have two Android phones (Samsung Note3, Redmi 4X) that both suffer from overheating after falling on the ground for several times. Take Redmi for example, before the impact I read about 50 degree/122F for SoC in CPU-Z when charging and now the number increased to 75 degree/167F. And this overheating could occur for no reason from time to time even when my phone isn't being charged (Sometimes when I browse Twitter the temperature could exceeds 60 degree/140F easily, and Twitter is obviously not a power-intensive application). Something must be wrong with my phone but I just couldn't figure it out. The outside of the phone still looks intact after the fall: the screen was not broken and functioning well (thanks to the casing); earpiece, camera, and fingerprint sensor are all working perfectly. Usually such heat could only come from three sources: running massive game/benchmark applications, continuous UHD/4K video recording, and short circuit. The first source is easy to exclude since I did not even have a single game installed on my phone, and I did not have a benchmark app either. Based on the amount of heat generated I then suspect that I was being spied by some trojan backdoor on my camera. However, after I removed SIM card and disable wifi, bluetooth, the heat continues, and I observed no significant diskspace change on my phone during overheating. That left short circuit to be the most likely source responsible. But where could that short circuit be in? Battery? SoC? How can my phone suffer from an internal short circuit but still works normally? I am really at my wit's end now. Reply Ruth June 18, 2018 at 6:15 am I keep my Android in my back pocket.

Christian Cawley March 18, 2017 at 3:38 pm Certainly an option -- there's a chance that an app you have installed has caused the problem. But for a new phone, it could be one of the pre-installed bloatware apps. James March 29, 2017 at 3:43 pm Hi Christian! U know what i did? I didn't bother restoring d factory data settings anymore.

Reply Gabrielle August 19, 2016 at 10:44 pm Pokemon Go is really my issue. But I also have a Sony Xperia Z3+ so known issues with overheating. Pokemon Go really saps my resources though. Drains battery fast and heats it up super fast. So what do I do? If I want to keep the game going, I sit it on an icepack. Yep, an icepack. I do have a flexible plastic case on the phone but it got hot even without it. I also wrap a cloth around the ice pack. I can get the phone too cold, at which time the touchscreen can get wiggy. So I take it off and let it warm up again then back on the ice pack. I'm considering getting a Z3 (no plus) instead but will probably still need to use the ice pack when I spend a long time on Pokemon Go. Until Niantic solves that problem and lessens the resource hogging of the app, anyway. Reply Christian Cawley August 26, 2016 at 2:12 pm Yeh, that doesn't sound particularly safe! Saying goodbye to Pokemon Go seems the best option.

May 3, 2016 at 10:24 pm I suppose the idea of \"underclocking\" the phone's CPU won't work? Ultimately a lot of the heat is just a matter of the CPU (which is just a glorified over-organized silicon space-heater) being overworked. There really should be a way to throttle back the clock rate to reduce this... But apparently there's not.

You say \"never charge y phone up to 100%\". Pls explain, how a usual phoneowner can manage this in a practical way??? I can not walk over there every half an hour just to have a look at the percentage of battery. Charging over night, as probably the biggest part of the people are doing, brings 100% in the morning;-) So what would you recommend to do? Regards Viera Reply Fik of borg February 28, 2016 at 1:54 pm Most phones drop to trickle charge after reaching 100%, so this is somehow controlled. It is conceivable an app with an adjustable \"drop to trickle\" level, but I haven't seen one (just hundreds of \"battery saving\" apps that just shut down systems). Failing that, some external hack that turns off and back on the charger at selectable levels, controlled from the phone via wifi (or bluetooth, or even the earphone jack). Maybe one of those wifi controlled home automation AC outlets. I smell project. Reply Christian Cawley February 28, 2016 at 4:29 pm Hey Viera I think Fik makes a good point, as it is impractical often, so a project that makes use of smart plugs might be ideal.. I'm in a position where I can charge during the day, but obviously that's not the case for many. In my case, I imagine I charge overnight - and therefore to 100% - about 30% of the time.
