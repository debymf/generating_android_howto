Would the other person know? Sometimes my friend will pause her video for less than 5 seconds but I can still hear her. Just wondering if she is screenshotting. Reply Jude June 26, 2018 at 11:56 am please I would like to know, is the data charge on whatsapp call on both parties or on the caller alone? Reply Kate April 2, 2018 at 6:19 pm I can't figure out how to manage the videos of me and the person I'm video calling with. What I mean is that it's usually the face of the other person I can see and my face in a square below; sometimes they swap (I don't know how and when this happens); sometimes the square below disappears at all and I can't see what my friend can see, etc. How do I manage this small square with my face during a video call, please? Reply LongIslandDave December 25, 2019 at 8:45 pm Did you know you can swap the images around on the video chat? When you start video chat, your image is small in the top right corner, and the other party is on the main screen, full screen. To swap the images - say you want to see more clearly the piece of paper you are showing them - simply tap on the small image, and the 2 images will swap. Tap it again to swap back.

I had some free time so I thought I would try out WhatsApp video for the first time. As I was walking in the countryside with no WiFi connection I was amazed at the Quality of the WhatsApp video call feature when I called my son in Las Vegas. We had a 10 minute phone conversation and the quality was excellent. WhatsApp is an amazing and well-thought-out app. I use it for sending videos and photos to my relatives overseas and the quality is outstanding.
