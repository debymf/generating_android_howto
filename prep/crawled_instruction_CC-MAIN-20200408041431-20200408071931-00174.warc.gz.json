Ask the assistant to make a reservation. You might say something like, \"Book a table at the Sunset Grill\" or \"Make an appointment at the Hair Boutique.\" If your request is general, such as, \"Make an appointment at a nail salon,\" Google Assistant presents you with choices. Select the desired establishment. Google Assistant prompts you for details such as the time, date, and number in your party. Tap Yes to confirm, No to change the details, or Cancel to stop the process. Google calls the business and interacts with whoever answers, providing and confirming your details. When the call and reservation are complete, Google Assistant gives you a voice confirmation within a few minutes. Google Assistant also informs you of any issues that arise when attempting to call in the reservation, such as the business not answering the phone. To cancel your reservation after it has been confirmed, give the OK Google command and tell Google Assistant to cancel your reservation.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/use-google-assistant-make-appointments-4689169", "index": 0}
