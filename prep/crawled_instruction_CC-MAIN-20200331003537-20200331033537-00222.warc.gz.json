If you don t see All Devices, it s because you ve already selected a device. Click the name of the current device in the center of the toolbar to access the Devices list, then select a new device. Click Lost Mode or Lock. Follow the onscreen instructions, keeping the following in mind: Passcode: If your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or Apple Watch has a passcode, it s required to unlock the device. Otherwise, you re asked to create a passcode now. If you re locking a Mac, you must create a numerical passcode, even if you already have a password set up on your Mac. This passcode is distinct from your password and is only used when you lock your Mac with Find My iPhone. Family Sharing: If you re trying to place a family member s iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch in Lost Mode and the device doesn t have a passcode set, you must enter that person s Apple ID password on this computer. If you re trying to lock a family member s Mac, you must enter that person s Apple ID password on this computer. Contact information: If you re asked to enter a phone number, enter a number where you can be reached. If you re asked to enter a message, you may want to indicate that the device is lost or how to contact you. The number and message appear on the device s Lock screen. Note: If you forget the passcode, or if you set an EFI firmware password on your Mac before it was lost, then lock it and later find it, you may need to take it to an authorized repair center to unlock it.", "url": "https://support.apple.com/en-bh/guide/icloud/mmfc0f0165/icloud", "index": 0}
