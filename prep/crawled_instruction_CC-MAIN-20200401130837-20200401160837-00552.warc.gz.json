Type your phone number or email address in the first text box provided on that page. Type the password you want to use for Twitter in the second box. Click or tap the Get started button. Type your full name in the new text box that shows up below your password. You can also tailor Twitter to your interests (based on your recent website visits). If you don't want this, uncheck the box on the signup page. Read this for more info on what this entails. Use the \"Advanced options\" link below the form if you want to disable other people from finding you on Twitter by searching for your personal information. You can selectively turn off the ability for people to find your Twitter account using your email or phone number. Click or tap the Sign Up button when finished. If you didn't do it already, you'll now be asked to enter your phone number, but you can use the Skip link at the bottom of that page if you want to avoid connecting your phone number to your Twitter account. You can always do this later. Choose a username on the next page by typing one in the text box or clicking a suggested one based on your name and email address. You can always change it later if you want, or you can skip this step with the Skip link and fill in your username later.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/join-twitter-by-setting-up-account-3486230", "index": 0}
