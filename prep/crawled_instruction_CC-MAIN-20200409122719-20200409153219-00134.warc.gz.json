Mail, Hotmail, Eudora, and some other email providers. But the CSV files that these applications produce might not contain all of the supported contact fields. For example, when Outlook exports to a CSV file, it omits data including attachments, distribution lists, contact pictures, the \"file as\" field, the \"nickname\" field, and text formatting in the \"notes\" field. Google Contacts doesn t have a way to know what was omitted, so we suggest that you manually copy over any important information in these fields after you import your contacts.
