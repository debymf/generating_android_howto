Reply mikesmusingblog October 5, 2012 at 12:49 pm I agree with the review except for the comments about only getting a MacBook Air if you travel a lot. One was recently gifted to a teen who wanted a Mac over an Ultrabook; it fits the backpack very well for school; and the price is only a little higher than the Ultrabooks considered. So if the deciding factor is which operating system do you prefer, the only choice is the MacBook Air. Reply Kevin Fegan October 5, 2012 at 3:00 am This is a great giveaway.

October 4, 2012 at 1:11 pm MUO, Outstanding contest. I have limited experience with Mac, but that has been spread over the years beginning with the first mac (I tried a $2,500 128K Macintosh in 1984). I've owned second-hand Apples (II, IIe, III) and at one point even had a LISA (also previously owned). I'd love to give Mac another shot at capturing me.

Best wishes to one and all for there tasks and challenges. Reply Richard Lim September 12, 2012 at 2:59 am I have only one older 13\" Macbook amongst my collection. My current road warrior gear is the older 12.1\" Toshiba Portege R600 with 128GB SSD that weights only 1kg with built-in DVD writer! Unfortunately, this (former top of the line ultralight) line is obsolete - a victim of its high price (~USD3000) but I love its pre-ultrabook features (way back then) - ultra long battery live, sun-light readable screen and still world leading 1kg weight.... Would love to have the Macbook Air take over its role as it is getting a bit long in the tooth... Yeah, I totally agree with the comment about the new Mac touchpad. Not used to the harder taps required.

I have been a newsletter subscriber for around 2 years but have not been able to enter your competitions.

But FREE is right in my price range! Reply Dee Wheat September 11, 2012 at 7:49 pm This would be amazing for me for several reasons, but the biggest one is that my wheelchair is calibrated to my weight so that it can safely balance on two wheels. Any addition or loss of just 20 pounds requires a recalibration. When I'm out doing a day long photoshoot, my camera equipment alone is almost enough to reach that limit, and when I add a laptop...netbooks won't work because they don't have nearly enough battery life....I'm well over my limit. I periodically during the day need to upload pics to make sure that I'm getting everything I need, and reviewing 8-16 gigs of pics in the camera is just not workable. The Macbook Air is EXACTLY what would solve the problem! Reply Shirley Desbiens September 11, 2012 at 7:41 pm nice giveaway .love your website.look forward to it everyday thank you !

Reply Lyn Sweetapple September 11, 2012 at 4:45 pm Your review is one of the more practical ones I have read recently. It included pros and cons in a very neutral way. As a survivor of the PC/Mac wars it was a delight to be informed and not preached to. For grammar trolls, I know I ended the last sentence in a preposition, but since Churchill supports doing so, I will continue to. Reply Jackson Chung September 11, 2012 at 6:15 pm Thank you, Lyn.

Reply Yang Yang Li September 10, 2012 at 9:40 pm Great article! I felt it was a fair review. No Apple fanboyism detected. \"There s only one reason you should own a MacBook Air: for the portability. Other than that, you re probably not spending your money wisely.\" - Nicely put, only one thing I would add. A Macbook Air will probably not fare well in a desert, arctic, or rainforest. Reply Jackson Chung September 11, 2012 at 7:57 am Thank you, Yang! I like Apple products but I'm not really a fanboy in the sense that I would be happy to use other hardware and devices if they prove to be better. Interesting point you made there. Actually, since the Air uses an SSD, I would assume that it will perform better than a MBP with a mechanical drive in extreme conditions. What do you think? Reply Yang Yang Li September 11, 2012 at 9:28 pm When I questioned the MBA's reliability, I was implicitly comparing it to ThinkPads/Elitebooks. As for the whole SDD vs HDD debate, I think a SDD performs better in an extreme environment. No moving parts means it is less likely for a SDD to be damaged by vibrations or drops. On the other hand, an HDD lasts longer in a server as a SSD will die after a certain number of write cycles. In my Elitebook, I have a SDD that allows me to use it in environments where vibrations are a problme. Reply Troy Thorsen October 2, 2012 at 2:13 pm I agree. I have setup my laptop and there was a 50% increase in performance. nikhil agarwal September 10, 2012 at 9:02 pm thanx for the giveaway Reply Pedro Oliva September 10, 2012 at 8:24 pm excellent review, i really hpe win this one :P Reply Brian Fagan September 10, 2012 at 8:23 pm Very cool!

You can install the MacOSX skin and dock and get the best of both. You have all the applications of Linux, and the looks of Mac. Apple excel in software quality, the problem with Linux is the flexibility. But you will find that most MacOS utilities are just port of Linux utilities. There are always issues with 99% adaptations, so make the full jump. Reply Thomas Bjarke Heiberg-I rgensen September 10, 2012 at 4:33 pm So I'm confused - is this the latest macbook air?

I use to have a macbook pro that finally broke after 5 years and I figured since I also have an iMac I didn't really need a macbook pro anymore, since the iMac does all the serious computing I need, so I went with the air. I love it because I travel with it to and from school and use it to take notes in all my classes as well as kill some time between classes. Its perfect in class because of the small desks some universities like to use. I also fly back home a lot so it has been great to use on the plane since it is so small. I have the 11 inch model. Reply Jackson Chung September 11, 2012 at 5:22 pm Awesome stuff, Chris. Thanks for sharing! How are you coping with the 11\" screen? Reply Chris September 11, 2012 at 5:34 pm It was really weird at first because I had grown accustomed to viewing things on my iMac which is 24 inches but after maybe 2 days I got use to it.

Reply Chris September 10, 2012 at 4:08 pm Yes you can. Its is easy. I run ubuntu on my iMac and its the same process. The only thing I would watch out for is the fact that the macbook air does not have a lot of memory. Thats why I dont dual boot on my air. At least with my iMac i have a 1TB hard drive so I was able to give ubuntu 200 gigs. Reply juanDM4 September 10, 2012 at 8:48 pm thank you sir, hope apple doesnt get angy when i go ubuntu on their toys :) Reply Chris September 11, 2012 at 5:38 pm Make sure you completely back up your computer before ever attempting it incase things go wrong. Apple wont get mad since its your computer and you can do what you want with it, however, they will not offer any support on using windows/linux on your mac so you will be on your own with that. Knut Flottorp September 11, 2012 at 7:40 pm .. on Mac, you use \"reFit\" to enable dual-boot. Be careful about writing to he Mac partition, because Ubuntu's hfs+ does not have the journalling bug.

Jonathan September 15, 2012 at 5:37 pm I meant no harm by my comment and I hardly think it can be categorized as \"trolling.\" If I wrote an article and took the amount of time I'm sure this author did to write it I'd want to know what final touches it needed to negate all cosmetic blemishes. Far be it from me to comment on an article attempting to help an author out, and far be it from the author to think I wasn't meaning wrong it. Comments on grammar are normally welcomed by publications, blogs etc. Forgive my laziness for not seeking out the email of the author to deal with this privately. If you are sensitive of your work to the point you don't want grammatical correctness... well I wouldn't even know what to think.

Reply Jackson Chung September 11, 2012 at 7:29 am Well, the MacBook Air is definitely less powerful and less capacious compared to the MacBook Pro. If you use it for less CPU-intensive work, it might be able to last just as long as the MBP. The purpose of owning a MBA is mainly for portability and convenience, and for that, there's definitely a premium. If you're looking for longevity, you should really get the MBP.
