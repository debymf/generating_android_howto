The Pixel's microphone is located underneath the screen, next to the USB-C charging port. This area is prone to dust and debris build up, and it could be blocking the microphone. Try removing any cases you have on your phone, especially third-party variations. If you noticed the issue in one app, check other apps that require the microphone for the same issue. If the problem is isolated to one app, uninstall the affected app and reinstall it from the Play Store. Restart your Pixel. Long press the power button on the right side of your device to display the power menu, then tap Restart . Test if the microphone can record any sound. Use an audio recording app to record a segment of audio. Include quiet and loud noises to test the full range of the microphone. A damaged or malfunctioning microphone might still pick up some sound. If the microphone is still unresponsive, your Pixel may suffer from the known hairline crack in the solder connection. In their response to the issue, Google committed to replacing affected devices. Contact Google Support to discuss the problem.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/fix-google-pixel-problems-4178480", "index": 0}

To view running apps, swipe up from the bottom of the screen (Android 10 and higher). Swipe an app up to close it. Restart your Pixel. Long press the power button on the right side of your device to display the power menu, then tap Restart . Navigate to Settings > Battery > Menu (the three dots at the top right of the screen) > Battery usage to view battery usage by app since the last full charge. If you notice any unusual or infrequently used apps towards the top of the list, uninstall them to see if they're the root of the excessive battery drain. Since the Pixel's release, some users have noted that certain Android features misbehave after a system update. Adaptive Brightness has been known to malfunction and uses an excessive amount of battery. To turn this feature off, head to Settings > Display > Adaptive Brightness and toggle the switch. If the problem persists, perform a factory reset of your Pixel. This will remove all files, apps, and settings, so ensure you've fully backed up your device before performing the reset. To begin, navigate to Settings > System > Advanced > Reset options , then tap Erase all data (factory reset) . If, after a factory reset, the problem still occurs, contact Google Support to discuss a potential hardware fault.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/fix-google-pixel-problems-4178480", "index": 1}
