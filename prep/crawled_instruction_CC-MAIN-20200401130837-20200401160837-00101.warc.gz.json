Your phone is no different. A restart or reboot may resolve a surprising number of problems. See How to Reboot an Android Smartphone or Tablet . Update Software Update your system software and apps. A flaw in system software can cause sporadic and unpredictable problems, Updating to the most current version at least gives you access to known and fixed system flaws. For an iPhone, see How To Download and Install New iOS Updates . If you have an Android phone, see How to Update Your Android OS . Update Apps Check for app updates in the App Store on an iPhone, or in the Google Play store on an Android device. (For more details, see How to Turn on Automatic App Updates on the iPhone and iPad or How to Update Apps on Android .) A bug in an app can affect your device s available memory and/or performance. The best software developers make an effort to maintain their software and publish periodic updates. Quit Apps Force the app to quit (or close). To quit an app, see How to Close Apps on the iPhone or How to Close Apps on Android . This helps when an app simply gets stuck in an unusable state. You tap it, but it doesn t open or doesn t respond. It s stuck. Much like on a computer, this stops the app so you can start it again. On iOS, you shouldn't need to quit apps with any regularity (even if it is fun to flick them off the screen). iOS pays attention to which apps should be running and stops the ones that don't need as much of your device's resources. Still, if an app is not behaving, you know what to do. Clear up Some Storage Free up storage space by storing videos and photos somewhere other than on your device. Videos can take up a significant amount of storage space. See either How to Free Up Storage on iPhone or How to Free Up Storage Space on Your Android Phone or Tablet . A lack of storage space may also cause a phone to pause or appear to stop working, and full (or almost full) storage may make your device respond more slowly. Remove Problem Apps If you notice that your phone freezes frequently after you open an app, you might want to remove that app. Some apps are simply flawed and/or crash-prone. See How to Delete Apps from Your iPhone or How Do I Delete Applications from My Android Device? to learn how to uninstall an app. Reset Your Phone If you ve tried all of the above steps and your phone still freezes, reset your phone. Make sure you have backed up your phone before you do a reset. To backup an iPhone, many people prefer iCloud (see What is iCloud? How Do I Use It? ), while Android backups can be done in many different ways (see How to Backup Your Android Phone ). A factory reset erases all the data from your phone and returns the device to its original state. After a reset, you ll need to go through the standard phone setup process, just as you did when your phone was new. See How to Restore an iPhone to Factory Settings or How to Reset an Android Phone or Tablet and Wipe All Data . Seek Professional Help After you ve tried all of the above steps and your phone still freezes, you might seek a specialist to figure out if there s a hardware problem with your device. If you have an iPhone, take your device to an Apple store or contact Apple Support . If you have an Android device, contact either the manufacturer of your phone or contact your carrier for support.
