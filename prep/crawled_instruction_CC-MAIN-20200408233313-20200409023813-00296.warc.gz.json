It s always a good idea to make sure you re running the latest version of iTunes, especially if you don t use it often, to make sure it will sync properly with your phone. If iTunes offers to install the latest update, let that occur before proceeding. From the iTunes music library, find a song that you want to turn into a ringtone and click on it to select the song. Play the song and decide what 30 second snippet of the song you want to make into a ringtone. It can be any point in the song. Write down the start and stop time so you know what time you ll set in a few steps. Right-click the song and choose Song Info from the drop-down menu. In the Song Info dialog box, click the Options tab. In the start and stop fields, enter the time you want the ringtone to start and stop and ensure box boxes are checked. For example, if you want the first 30 seconds of the song, choose 0:00 and 0:30. Click OK when you re done. Your ringtone must not exceed 30 seconds or it won t work, so be sure you do your math correctly. Click the File menu and choose Convert , then Convert to AAC Version . After a moment, you should see the new version of the song appear in the music library, directly under the currently selected original version of the track. On older versions of iTunes, you might need to right-click the song and choose Create AAC Version from the drop-down menu. Select the new AAC version of the song and copy it to a location on your computer. You can simply drag it to your desktop or another folder. Back in iTunes, you won t need that newly created AAC version, so you can delete it by pressing the Delete key. The original track is still set to only play for 30 seconds, so you can fix that as well. Right click the track and choose Song Info . On the Options tab, clear the checkmarks for start and stop . Click OK to save your changes. Now, locate the ringtone file you had copied out of iTunes. On a PC, click the View tab at the top of the folder and then check File name extensions in the ribbon. If you're using a Mac, click the Finder menu, and then choose Preferences .In the Finder Preferences, check Show all filename extensions . Click on the song file and then, after a moment, click it a second time so you can edit the filename. Click the filename extension and change it from M4A to M4R , and press Enter. If requested, confirm that you want to make this change.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-make-a-song-your-ringtone-on-iphone-4771020", "index": 0}
