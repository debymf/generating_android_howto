Go to https://www.facebook.com/ in your computer's web browser. This will open your Facebook News Feed if you're logged into Facebook. If you aren't logged into Facebook, enter your email address (or phone number) and password in the upper-right side of the page, then click Log In . Image titled Advertise on Facebook Step 2 2 Create a business page if you don't already have one. In order to create ads, you must first have at least one page on Facebook. If you have a page that isn't linked to your business, it's strongly recommended that you create a business page before continuing. Image titled Advertise on Facebook Step 3 3 Click the \"Menu\" Image titled Android7dropdown.png icon. It's in the top-right corner of the Facebook News Feed page. Clicking it prompts a drop-down menu. In some areas and versions of Facebook's website, this will be a gear-shaped icon instead. Image titled Advertise on Facebook Step 4 4 Click . You'll find this option near the bottom of the drop-down menu. Doing so will open Facebook's Power Editor, which is its ad creator. Image titled Advertise on Facebook Step 5 5 Select a marketing objective. Click one of the tabs below the \"What's your marketing objective\" heading. Your selected marketing objective is up to you, though your ad's initial preferences will differ depending on your selected objective. Image titled Advertise on Facebook Step 6 6 Scroll down and enter a name for your campaign. In the \"Campaign Name\" text box, type in whatever you want to name your ad campaign. The title that you enter here is private, and serves only to differentiate this ad campaign from other ones that you run later. If you selected the Conversions objective, you'll also have to click the \"Key Result\" drop-down box and then click the result that you want. If you selected the Engagement objective, you'll first need to select a type of engagement below the \"Engagement\" heading. For some objectives, you can check the \"Create Split Test\" checkbox in order to run two sets of ads at once so that you can compare them side-by-side. Image titled Advertise on Facebook Step 7 7 Click . It's a blue button at the bottom of the page. This will take you to the main ad setup section, where you can begin by defining your audience.
