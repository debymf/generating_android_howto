On iPhone X and later and all iPads, swipe down from the upper-right corner of the screen. Press and hold your finger on the upper-left box with the airplane buttons. In the next menu, tap the AirDrop button. The next screen reveals your options for the permissions. The settings are Receiving Off , which turns off AirDrop completely; Contacts Only , which only lets you receive files from people in your contacts list; and Everyone , which lets anyone in range send you things via AirDrop. The safest option is Contacts Only . AirDrop doesn't present any security risks on its own, but you may not want strangers sending you unsolicited files in public.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-airdrop-how-does-it-work-1994512", "index": 0}
