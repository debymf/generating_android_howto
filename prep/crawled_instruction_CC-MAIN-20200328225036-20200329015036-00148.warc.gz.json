Then select the keyboard icon. When the keyboard appears, select the > symbol at the top of the keyboard. Here you can tap the clipboard icon to open the Android clipboard. If you've never used the clipboard before on your phone, you'll see a notification to turn on the Gboard clipboard. Just tap Turn on clipboard . Once you do this, any time you copy anything to the clipboard and then tap the clipboard on the Google Android keyboard again, you'll see a history of all recent items you've added to the clipboard. To delete any of these items from the clipboard, tap the edit icon and select each item you want to delete. Then tap the trash icon to delete them. The clipboard manager that comes with your native keyboard app depends largely on the version and brand of your Android phone. For example, the Samsung Keyboard features a clipboard manager tool as well. The keyboard is typically the primary way to access and manage your clipboard without an app.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/using-the-clipboard-on-android-phones-4766586", "index": 0}
