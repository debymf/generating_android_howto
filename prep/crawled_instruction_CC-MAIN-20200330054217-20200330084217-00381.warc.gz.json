If Wi-Fi is one of your quick controls there (it most likely is), tap Wi-Fi . You may see a network name rather than the word \"Wi-Fi.\" Tap Details . If Wi-Fi is off on your device, tap the toggle switch to enable it. Now, your device will search for networks. If you see the one you want, tap it. If not, you may need to enter the network's name; tap Add Network . If you do have to set up your network automatically, make sure you use the right Security setting. Tap the security dropdown menu, then tap WPA/WPA2/FT PSK . If the network is secured, you'll be prompted by Android for a password, in which case a dialog will appear. If the network is unsecured, you'll see a couple of messages go by, such as one about getting an IP address, then you should be connected. Once you provide this password, you should get connected.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/add-wifi-network-to-any-device-4685456?utm_source=emailshare&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=shareurlbuttons", "index": 0}
