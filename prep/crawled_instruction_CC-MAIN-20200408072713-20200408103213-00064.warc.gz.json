They may not want to give you this information since it could give you access to their account, so you may need to physically give them the device. Start up the device and, when it gets to the Activation Lock screen, enter the original Apple ID username and password (or have the person who sold you the iPad do it). This will allow the iPad to continue booting up. When the iPad gets to the home screen, sign out of iCloud. On iOS 10.2 and earlier, tap Settings > iCloud > Sign Out . On iOS 10.3 and later, tap Settings > [your name] > Sign Out . When the iPad asks for the original owner's Apple ID username and password again, enter it. Turn off Find My iPad and Activation Lock. The next step depends on the version of the iOS running on the iPad. On iOS 10.2 and earlier, tap Sign Out > Delete from My iPhone . On iOS 10.3 and up, tap Turn Off . Now, erase any remaining data and settings on the iPad by tapping Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings . The iPad will restart. You shouldn't see the Activation Lock screen this time and should be able to set up the iPad like new.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/remove-icloud-activation-lock-from-ipad-4586831", "index": 0}
