Choose food items with a long shelf life, such as canned goods and packaged pantry items. Opt for items that don t require refrigeration, but also those that require little cooking in case you don t have power due to a disaster. Store 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water per person (and per pet) per day. Don t forget formula and bottles if you have an infant, as well as pet food for any pets. [9] Tap water may be unsafe to drink in the event of a disaster, so be sure to include plenty of purified water in bottles or jugs. Canned soup, tuna, nuts, dried fruit, beef jerky, nut butter, protein bars, cereal, powdered milk, dry pasta, and packaged crackers are good options. Don t forget to pack a can opener, utensils, dishes, waterproof matches, and a camp stove, if possible. At the minimum you should have a 3 day supply of food and water ready, but it s best to store enough for 2 weeks. Image titled Be Prepared for Natural Disasters Step 9 2 Include clothing, shoes, and toiletries. Pack a 3-day supply of clothing (including multiple layers), socks, and an extra pair of shoes for each member of the family. Toiletries, like soap, shampoo, feminine products, toilet paper, toothbrushes, toothpaste, and deodorant should also be included. Add diapers and wipes if you have small children. [10] Image titled Be Prepared for Natural Disasters Step 10 3 Add shelter and safety supplies. Pack emergency blankets, sleeping bags, and a tent or two in case you can t stay in your home. A multipurpose tool (like a knife/file/pliers/screwdriver combo), and a whistle would also be handy to have in your kit. [11] Image titled Be Prepared for Natural Disasters Step 11 4 Pack electronics and batteries. Include several flashlights, an AM/FM radio, and extra batteries. You may also want to include a prepaid cell phone with a charger in case your landline or cell phone doesn t work during a natural disaster. [12] Image titled Be Prepared for Natural Disasters Step 12 5 Include medicine and a first aid kit. Prescription and over-the-counter medicines should be included in your kit. Add a basic first aid kit containing instant ice packs, bandages, antiseptic ointment, scissors, tape, a suture kit, and so on. Pack extra glasses or contact lenses and solution, and any other medical supplies that may be needed, like a cane or hearing aids with extra batteries. [13] You may want to include a field medicine handbook as well as a veterinary medicine handbook if you have pets. [14] Image titled Be Prepared for Natural Disasters Step 13 6 Add cash, maps, and spare keys. It s a good idea to store some cash in your emergency kit. Add a mix of small and large bills in case the banks or ATMs are closed. You should also include maps of the area as well as a spare house and car key. [15] Image titled Be Prepared for Natural Disasters Step 14 7 Store the kit in a cool, dry place. To make sure your food and water last as long as possible, don t store your kit near direct sunlight, excess moisture, or fluctuating temperatures. The ideal temperature range is from 40 to 70 F (4 to 21 C). While bathrooms and kitchens aren t great options, basements and closets will do just fine. [16] You may choose to prepare a second kit and store it in your car, if desired. Image titled Be Prepared for Natural Disasters Step 15 8 Put important papers in a fireproof and waterproof lockbox. Important papers could be lost in a natural disaster, so fill the box with copies of each family member s ID as well as birth certificates, passports, deeds, and titles. You could also include insurance paperwork, immunization records, and a copy of your family emergency plan. Add a list of phone numbers and addresses for family members and other important contacts, too. [17] Keep both the box and key in your emergency kit. Alternatively, you can scan important documents and store them on memory stick inside of a waterproof container in your kit. Image titled Be Prepared for Natural Disasters Step 16 9 Rotate the items regularly. To ensure the clothes and shoes fit and the food and medicine aren t expired, you should rotate out the items every year or two. Purchase new supplies for your packs and use the existing supplies for your day to day needs. [18] Advertisement", "url": "https://www.wikihow.com/Be-Prepared-for-Natural-Disasters", "index": 0}
