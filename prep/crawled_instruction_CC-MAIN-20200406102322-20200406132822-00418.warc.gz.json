Reply Jamie September 15, 2016 at 7:30 pm Microsoft OneNote is definitely a strong contender to choose, however, it has one KEY drawback and highlighted today (9/15/2016). OneNote absolutely relies on the Microsoft OneDrive server working. Microsoft's OneDrive server today has been down for the better part of the day. What does this mean? Well, unless you previously loaded the notebook you wanted to use before the server went down you will not be able to make any kind of note. Nothing! This kind of situation is crucial to consider when looking at which notebook system to use. I am at a loss right now and trying to figure out a good alternative that works on both Mac and Windows.

I downloaded the full version but when I went to install it, said I couldn't install because I have some 32 bit office programs on my pc, and Onenote won't work. Not really excited about buying a new office suite, just to get a few more features in onenote, since I don't use office that often. Typical mess Microsoft makes of things.

I bet text search worked in '86. Reply Rob Nightingale July 20, 2016 at 1:03 pm huh, that's strange, James.

This is the #1 reason I can't stand outlook. Example: search for a word, say 'examples' type 'exa' - matches for example appears type 'example' - matches disappear type 'examples' - matches reappear (not tested with this exact word but that's not the point) I was just trying OneNote. So far, I found those things will keep me from it. If I would have had a windows computer, would have been otherwise, but can't take the battery hit of running VMWare ALL THE TIME. (Maybe works satisfying on an iPad? Don't have one yet though. My urge for good notes organisation maybe calls for a windows tablet.) 1. PDF-export breaks WITHIN lines (upper half of characters on one page, lower on next) - and I really need a way to export data for regular archiving, as well as for sharing with others. 2. Language settings for spelling does not work on Mac when typing English on a Swedish keyboard. No global or per notebook setting. Does not follow \"language settings\" in macOS. 3. Can not change datestamp on Mac nor web version. Reply Alan Henderson December 17, 2016 at 7:56 am I've had the same thing happen regularly with Evernote. I've been testing all the note taking products for a couple of days because I'm over Evernote's bloat. Been a paying customer since the beginning. The only thing it has that I'd miss is a great tagging setup. New kids on the block which are promising: the beautiful (but Mac and iOS) only Bear at $15 p.a.; and Dropbox's free Paper. Paper requires a Dropbox account and doesn't have tags but it's in Beta and may get them soon. I create my own searchable tags :- \\computer, \\important, etc. Reply VanguardLH July 12, 2016 at 12:43 am Too bad Microsoft decided to punish Android uses. Yes, they have an Android version of OneNote. It does NOT support locked (password encrypted) sections in a notebook. That means all my notes are inaccessible on my smartphone (unless I go to onedrive.com to access my notebook via web browser but their AJAX2 web site is slow and clumsy). Their Windows app supports locking so they know the code needed to port to Android. They just don't do it. They've been promising for over a year to add locking/encryption support. Yeah, like I'm going to wait around for them to make up their mind whether or not to port existing code. As for Evernote, not an option, either. Why? Remember that OneNote is FREE. So stop comparing payware features when discussing comparison to OneNote. If an alternative does not have the same features in their freeware version then they are NOT an alternative. OneNote can use notebooks in the cloud (okay, a server-side copy of the notebook) but also supports a locally cached copy of the notebook. You can access your notebook when offline. You can NOT access your Evernote notes when offline. If you are out of range of an Internet connection or simply don't want one at the moment, forget accessing your Evernote notes because they are only in your online account. Yes, Evernote includes offline caching if you pay for it but OneNote has this in their FREE version. Evernote is really way behind the marketplace regarding their feature set. It's as if they don't care about being competitive. Reply Rob Nightingale July 13, 2016 at 11:58 am You make some valid points, but if a user doesn't use some of the differentiating features, then relatively, the two packages can most definitely be alternatives... it's all about figuring out which features you actually need. Reply Stau July 11, 2016 at 9:10 pm I use memosnag (memosnag.com). If your main use case is saving stuff you find online and take notes / photos in an organized place, then memosnag is perfect and is 100% FREE! The browser plugin for Chrome and Firefox is a better option than clipper and pinterest. In fact you can capture pretty much anything: images, youtube videos, text, webpages... Everything is saved in the cloud and is accessed though you personal memosnag account across devices. There are no limits to the numbers of devices. You can also organize your content in folders (Collections) and share them with other users, publicly, or keep them private. The iOS app is very well done. Android as far as I know will come out in December. It's a startup and the functionalities are very simple and unsophisticated, which I actually really like. I love what these guys are doing.

Reply Rob Nightingale July 13, 2016 at 1:49 pm It's that limited number of devices that's either going to push me to use OneNote, or keep on with the Premium package from Evernote.. I've not decided which yet... Reply Andrew T June 29, 2016 at 2:30 pm I just got word that Evernote is changing their free account, limited to just two devices. I'm using my phone, tablet, and computer web browser (no Linux version of Evernote). So I suppose I can live without the web browser, but if they're starting to put more limitations on basic accounts, how long before they kill basic accounts altogether. I found your article as a result... I'm no fan of Microsoft, but I'll give OneNote a try, and hopefully they don't follow suit and stop being free for unlimited devices. Reply Rob Nightingale July 13, 2016 at 1:50 pm What did you think of OneNote, Andrew? Reply Brett June 28, 2016 at 10:10 pm Rob - Quick question for you ... I tried importing my Evernote notebooks into OneNote using the Microsoft importer tool, but unless I'm missing something the URLs that appear on Evernote do not get transferred to OneNote. When I use the Evernote web clipper, the URL gets saved to Evernote in addition to the web content, so that I can easily access the original site again down the road. On OneNote, that URL is seemingly gone. Am I missing something? This seems like a critical oversight. Reply Rob Nightingale July 13, 2016 at 1:51 pm Do you mean URLS that you import from Evernote notes into OneNote are no longer linking to their respective sites (or are these internal links, linking to other notes?) Reply Ashish Bogawat May 31, 2016 at 11:46 am Quip has been improving dramatically over the last few months and I have seriously started using it instead of Evernote for work related notes.

I do most of my note taking as small snippets and OneNote is a little more clunky than I'd like on mobile. There have been many times that I had to force close the app because I couldn't interact with my notes anymore. The checklist in keep is much more user friendly than the one in OneNote. The freeform notes in OneNote are actually a con for me instead of a pro because I almost never use it and it makes using it for simple notes more cumbersome. That being said, OneNote on desktop is quite a nice app. Onetastic,if you haven't heard of it, is a great set of addons to extend OneNote.

Reply Rob Nightingale May 18, 2016 at 10:34 am Any tips on working around the issues, Kelsey? :) Reply Kelsey Tidwell May 18, 2016 at 5:56 pm Well, Rob, the most effective way of fixing a non-syncing notebook is to open another notebook, copy the contents of the first into the second, then delete the first. It's clunky, but it's saved me quite a lot of pain lol. This technique is actually recommended by the OneNote tech staff. Why they don't just reevaluate the syncing process, identify the holes in efficiency, and plug them instead of recommending a kludge like this is beyond me. Another sync situation involved (if I recall correctly) my having the same file open in two different locations at the same time, deleting an item in one, adding an item in the other, and something happening in between to where I got a message like, \"can't reconcile differences\" or some such. You'd think that it happened because of throwing too much at the system at once, but then isn't that episode the picture of collaboration? I'll say that Google Drive has never ever made a mistake in collaborative situations like that, so now if I use OneNote at all I have to be like, Step 1, now Step 2, now Step 3. Cautious. Ron May 6, 2016 at 1:54 pm OneNote has garbled my notes on several occasions, crashed on other occasions (thus losing the projects I'd been working on), and cannot maintain consistency across multiple platforms. I find all this positive praise to be counter to my experience. Coupled with Microsoft's latest creeping around like malware, and I'll just have to believe those of you having a great experience are the lucky ones. Granted, Evernote has its issues, which I'm desperately trying to get away from and looking for a viable alternative, but OneNote has been painful to use. I don't like these options. Reply Anonymous May 7, 2016 at 4:06 am Due to much of the same issues you're having, I'm using Google Drive as a pseudo-OneNote. It's not that hard to pattern Docs along the lines of OneNote pages, but it's also not as smooth. I can overlook that since all Docs format files take up ZERO Drive storage allotment...which begins at the free 15GB mark (as OneDrive USED to before the great New Years Day screw the pooch-fest). I was really getting into the handwritten note function in OneNote, and had a bit of angst over how that would survive going to Google Drive. Fortuitously, Google Keep had a recent update adding that very thing! Yay! I'm on Android, so when I make a quick handwritten note, I simply share it to Google Drive...done! My setup isn't flawless, but in lieu of not having a team of engineers to code another slick solution for me, it works pretty well I'd say. Reply Rob Nightingale May 8, 2016 at 3:46 pm Using Google Docs is an interesting alternative! I've always hated the user interface of GOogle Docs though, so doubt I'd go down the same route. Reply Anonymous May 8, 2016 at 4:06 pm Yes, the interface is bland in typical minimalist Google fashion lol. OneNote wins hands-down there for sure, and it's the one biggest feature I hated leaving for Drive. However, Drive's appearance can be drastically improved by displaying the files as graphical tiles, as in the various speed dial examples in Chrome and Opera and other browsers, or the Win 8/8.1/10 Start Page. Thanks for taking the time to reply! Happy Mother's Day! Anonymous May 8, 2016 at 4:27 pm There is of course 1 important issue with Google Drive: privacy. Everything you put in there is accessible & copied by Google. With the desktop version of OnNote you can save everything locally, encrypt, then upload to the cloud. Reply Anonymous May 8, 2016 at 4:44 pm I agree Peter. Nice to talk with you again, BTW. I don't ever put ANY sensitive information online. That issue has been brought up a few times on Google Forums, and Google reps assure over and over that all of your data is encrypted and secure. Google's assurances don't hold water with me because I don't trust Google at all, but neither do I trust ANY online service. There are no wholly honest companies, because they always reserve the right to change terms. No guarantees, so...no critical data online. Anonymous May 8, 2016 at 4:50 pm Addendum: case in point on no guarantees...Microsoft abruptly took away the free 15gb OneDrive limit, along with the companion free 15gb gained if you linked your phone to upload photos automatically to OneDrive. They dropped the limit to 5gb in total. Even though they later allowed previous users to sign up to retain their 15 or 30gb levels, it wasn't out of integrity. It was because of the firestorm that broke out over their scummy methods. But the point is, in both cases, they made major changes arbitrarily, because THEY wanted to...not because users had any control over it. How can they or any other online service be trusted? Well, none of them can. Rob Nightingale May 18, 2016 at 10:30 am There's always going to be an issue with privacy and security. In my own view, there is little choice but to make a trade between privacy and innovation. Data is currency these days. if you want great service, you need to abandon some of your privacy. Just be careful what, exactly, you give up. MaMtt May 10, 2016 at 3:00 pm How would one do this encryption process? Kelsey Tidwell May 18, 2016 at 6:00 pm MaMtt, The encryption I mentioned re:Google Drive is an automatic process that (I don't believe) the user has any control over. Sanjay May 6, 2016 at 11:17 am What about price? Evernote free version has monthly 60mb which is enough for enough savings But onenote has now only 5gb storage which is one drive storage Sooner it's going to be a issue That is the only reason that's stopping me to switch back to one note Reply Herman May 6, 2016 at 6:40 pm Indeed Sanjay, it seems nobody know that... I've EN Premium and I can upload 10GB each month ($45/y)! When I look at my Lumia 920 (Windows Phone) the 1N app works bad and looks bad. It's seems to be better on IOS (see images above).

Reply Anonymous May 8, 2016 at 4:31 pm I've never had a Windows phone, though I've always wanted one, and it's really surprising that a Microsoft app looks worse than on an iPhone. BUT.... It does seem to me that I remember when I started experimenting in earnest with OneNote back last July, there were several situations where the iOs version actually had better features, at least for a while. I don't know if that's the case now. It will pay to keep checking in from time to time for comparison's sake.

I've dabbled with them before, but was never truly satisfied, however it may work for you. It does seem that the recipes seem to be more favorable to syncing OneNote items into Evernote, rather than the other way around, so that would mean mainly using OneNote day-to-day, which might not be comfortable for you. You may see the recipes differently. There's other services like IFTTT out there too, but I have no experience there. Good luck and Happy Mother's Day!

Hopefully this helps. Reply Auldtwa May 6, 2016 at 12:10 am I've been using OneNote for years. The huge feature is the Notebook/Tab/notes you mention. I used it for my law practice and kept copies of the statutes I used all the time on it. I was legendary for being able to find cites instantly. Before I traveled for 3 months in Europe, I made myself guidebooks from stuff on the web: Wikipedia, Lonely Planet, museum sites,city websites, etc. You can cross reference, for example, from museums to artists (you can use hyperlinks within OneNote notebooks or sections or pages). You can actually make PDF e books from your collection. My travel was before iPad came out, so I read my homemade guide books on a Kindle DX. Now any tablet would make it really simple. I keep my daily journal in OneNote on pages I set up as a template so that I always cover the basics of what I want to record. I've done this since 2013: I can instantly, for example, search and find when exactly I read Ready Player One or when my dog's last vet appointment was. The search feature is fantastic. Clip to OneNote is often clunky, but you can PRINT to OneNote for anything that you can print on paper. It is, in fact, my default printer. When you use the print-to feature, you can choose exactly where you want to stick the item. Even on the same page as something you saved earlier. I use Evernote for stuff I scan since my scanner has a direct-to-Evernote feature. I use Evernote for things I know I'm going to want to save from the web and mark up (like a page of book recommendations) --it is a little bit clunkier to check items off a list from a \"printed\" OneNote page. I'm now using Vivaldi as my browser (love it!!) and it doesn't seem to have a direct to OneNote gadget yet. But Safari does, and Firefox and the Microsoft twins. Basically, Evernote is good for quick notes and quick saves and for situations, like my scanner, where interconnected functionality is built in. But OneNote dances rings around it for rational organization. Reply Anonymous May 7, 2016 at 3:58 am You might research using Chrome extensions in Vivaldi, since it is actually a child of Chromium. I also like Vivaldi very much, though I've opted to use Opera Developer for now...another Chromium descendant. However, I'm keeping up with and installing every Vivaldi update that comes along...you never know lol. Anyway, the point is, I can run Chrome extensions in Opera due to the similar code, and I'd wager you can too in Vivaldi. I just haven't tried it yet. :) That would allow you to use the OneNote clipper extension...which I'm using in Opera. Good luck, and happy day. Reply Anonymous May 8, 2016 at 4:22 pm I recently switched from Chrome to Opera Developer too because of the \"VPN\" feature. I can confirm Chrome extensions can be added to Vivaldi, but often don't work well, they work a lot better in Opera. I had high hopes from Vivaldi but have been disappointed by the clunkiness, perhaps because I am not patient enough, not indulgent enough with this new program. I think I will stick with Opera. Reply Rob Nightingale May 8, 2016 at 3:48 pm Agreed! I still haven't abandoned Evernote, despite loving OneNote. Reply Praveen May 5, 2016 at 4:57 pm I tried migrating from Evernote to Onenote last week. The features are all same. However, I find two main issues because of which I traced back: 1. Onenote web is less responsive then Evernote web. 2. Onenote firefox addon features are way below the evernote firefox addon. Reply Rob Nightingale May 18, 2016 at 10:23 am Not sure if it would help, but if you use OneNote a lot, would it be worth changing browser (perhaps to Chrome?) Reply Anonymous May 5, 2016 at 4:50 pm I used Evernote for 2 years but got fed up with its poor, amateurish editing & formatting. Also it was terrible with tables. Then there is the organisation: Evernote relies on tags & a powerful search syntax, which is fine & necessary to find your notes, but I prefer the visual to the bucket-type organisation of Evernote. OneNote's search is more than adequate. 1 year ago I decided to switch to OneNote & have never looked back. I have worked out an organisation model which combines notebooks, tabs/sections, tables & tables of contents, and keeps my pages/notes to a minimal level. This way I have everything within easy reach, particularly with the visual & OneNote's search. 1 thing about the free version of OneNote: it has 1 or 2 fewer features than the desktop version. I don't use the free web version but if I am not mistaken 1 of the missing features is OCR. I have looked at a number of other note-taking apps, including wiki-style apps, some of which have features OneNote does not have. Nothing is perfect in life so one has to set priorities & make compromises. Each time OneNote came out on top, hands down. All of these comments represent my humble opinion & are based on my use case. Reply Rob Nightingale May 8, 2016 at 3:49 pm Yea, I think it's the same with the Mac version. One crazy thing I really miss in OneNote is the ability to search for notes using Mac's spotlight. If they had that feature, I would probably abandon Evernote altogether. Reply MrBrady May 5, 2016 at 4:48 pm Interesting article. Thanks for posting! I've always shied away from OneNote only because it's part of Microsoft Office and I don't like Office, especially the Mac version. But after reading this article I'll give it a try. Reply Auldtwa May 6, 2016 at 12:15 am I believe OneNote was originally an independent app that Microsoft bought and simply provided along with Office. So you can think of it as the UnOffice part of Office. Reply Stefan Wischner May 6, 2016 at 6:07 am Not exactly. To be precise OneNote was a \"private\" side project from a Microsoft employee (John Guin if I am right) and soon became the \"killer app\" to promote the unsuccessful Windows XP for tablets in 2003. After that died OneNote has been a rather expensive stand alone program and was bundled into MS Office 2007 for the first time. It received a few connectors to other office modules to make it look as a part of the office suite but works perfectly without Word or Excel installed. OneNote 2013 was the last version which could also be bought separately. In 2014 Microsoft started the Mac version, offered a stripped down version of OneNote 2013 for free (basically without the option to store notes locally and without the connectors to other Office modules), rebuild the iOS version and introduced an Android version. All for free except the one still bundled with office and offering the most features. Greetings from germany, Stefan Wischner, Microsoft MVP 2015, 2016 for OneNote. Reply Auldtwa May 6, 2016 at 6:27 am Thanks. I knew it wasn't entirely Office-y. I used it before 2007, so my company must have bought the stand alone part. Rob Nightingale May 8, 2016 at 3:50 pm It's definitely worth giving it a try MrBrady :) Reply Roberto May 5, 2016 at 4:48 pm I was used to use Onenote along Keep, Asana and the paid version of Evernote. Since I have subscribed to Office365 I decided to get rid of all note taking apps but Onenote. Because of the nice integration of Onenote with Outlook Tasks I don't need neither Asana anymore. I have used a free tool to import all my notes I had in Evernote to Onenote. So far I'm still happy with the decision and I'm not going back. Reply Rob Nightingale May 8, 2016 at 3:51 pm Did you find reorganizing your Evernotes in OneNote easy? I might do this soon, but I have well over 10,000 notes, so am a little scared of the mess it could make... Reply Roberto May 9, 2016 at 12:38 am Migration wasn t so flawless especially with the notes that were clipped from web pages. (formatting issues, missing pictures) If I could go back I would at first delete all irrelevant notes from Evernote. For clipped webpages I would open the pages in the browser from the original link in Evernote then clip them again with Onenote clipping tool as the result with Onenote clipping tool is far better than with the Evernote one. Reorganization in Onenote is more easy as you can easily drag and drop pages from one tab to another or copy/move a whole bulk of pages at once. I didn t have so many notes in Evernote like you. I had \"only\" about 2000. Reply Rob Nightingale May 18, 2016 at 10:22 am Thanks Roberto. I'll get around to this one day, when I have some spare time :)", "url": "https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-evernote-alternative-onenote-free/", "index": 0}
