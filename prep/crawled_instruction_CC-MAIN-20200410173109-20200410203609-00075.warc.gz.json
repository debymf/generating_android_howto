My daughter s Android phone (LG G2) is locked. We are at the screen to enter the Backup Pin or Account Unlock (username and password). She enters her correct (and only) Google Account name and password and it does not work. She cannot remember the PIN. We have tried the PIN and PUK from the Sim card. We have seen your great solutions at https://joyofandroid.com/how-to-unlock-android-phone/ . But her problem is that WiFi is not turned on on her phone and she does not have a data plan so Google s reset password plan won t work and there is no way to get the Screen Lock Bypass app onto her phone (is there?). Why won t her phone accept her Google account name and password? Is there another way? Or is there any other way to get her phone to turn on Wifi? We can t do Command Line prompts because the phone won t connect to the computer. Thanks! Reply Martin D on September 3, 2014 We understand the problem completely. Usually when you type google account and its password it will unlock the phone. But you should have internet connection either wifi or data plan for it. Press and hold the power button to get the options to enable data plan. If you do not have data plan for the current sim, purchase from online. Or borrow from friends who has data plan. The other way is hard resetting the phone. This will delete the phone data completely, hence I do not recommend this method. Reply Denon on June 1, 2015 This helped me so much.

The only options available from that point seemed limited, but after messing with it a bit, I found a pretty simple solution(after scanning this whole thread to no avail): 1. Select emergency call . 2. Use another phone to call the one you re trying to unlock(assuming you have the correct Google login info and an available internet connection on the locked phone when normally unlocked) 3. The locked phone will ring normally(mine did at least). Answer the call. After answering, you should be able to pull down the shortcut menu and enable whichever connection you have available(Wi-Fi, data). Do so before ending the call, ensuring a successful connection. 4. Enter your Google login info into the empty spaces just the same as you probably have for what seems like forever now. 5.

You have non-rooted phone with USB debug disabled, no Google or Samsung account the worst situation ever. Download respective version Odin and flash you device with root firmware, then with TWRP bootloader / recovery manager. Use external SD card and copy /data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases/settings.db to it. Then download any of SQLITE DB files editor and set lockscreen.disabled to 1. Copy the file back and remove cached DB files (extention other then DB) in that directory.

My only advantage is i have WIFI enabled. 1. I have tried Andriod device manager method. But Lock option doesnt seem to work in Lollipop version. I just got the message that device is locked by android device manager. It doesnt work. 2. I have tried Screenlock Bypass Pro installation from browser. But it doesnt seem to be compatible with my device. My device is listed but it is greyed out. 3. There is no Forgot Password option when i enter incorrect password 5 or more times. That option is not there in Lollipop version. So couldnt give my google login to unlock. Please help me. Also i can use my phone in Guest mode, where i can make or recieve calls. I would be happy if i can atleast recover my pictures in phone. Great if i can bypass unlock somehow. Regards, Shiva. Reply erl.j on April 28, 2015 i reset my android phone because i couldn t receive a message, but when i turned it on it asks for a pin and i don t know the pin. how could i unlock it? .i tried to connect it to the computer but the computer could not detect it . please help me Reply Judy on August 11, 2015 Hi there, Have you tried all of the methods in this post? One reason why your computer may not be detecting your phone could be because of a faulty USB cord or a damaged USB port on either your phone or computer. Please try using a different cord or connecting the phone to another computer to help troubleshoot the problem. If no other solutions work, you phone may have internal hardware problems.

I forgot the password and tried several to get in, it failed. I found this link and thought I might try the android ADB. I downloaded all the necessary things from Java (JDK version 7) and others (all for windows 10 x64 which would be compatible with my pc). When I finally got the Android Studio setup working and got the whole thing downloaded and ready, I did what it said above and typed everything word for word (and letter for letter) into command prompt. When I got the second line down (cd android-sdk\\platform-tools\\), it said that The system cannot find the path specified. I tried typing it in several times and they all failed. Did I download something for x86 or make an error somewhere in the process? ps. When I enter the wrong password 5 times in a row it says wait 30 seconds to try again , but there is never an option like forgot password? where I can use another method to get into phone. It just says emergency call . Reply Judy on January 31, 2016 Hi Michael, Did you have USB debugging on? If not you can try the following: 1. On a computer or other mobile phone, visit: google.com/android/devicemanager 2. Sign in using your Google login details that you also used on your locked phone. 3. In the ADM interface, select the device you need to unlock (if it isn t already selected). 4. Select Lock 5. In the appearing window, enter a temporary password. You don t have to enter a recovery message. Now click Lock again. 6. If it was successful, you should see a confirmation below the box with the buttons Ring, Lock and Erase. 7. On your phone, you should now see a password field in which you should enter the temporary password. This should unlock your phone. Now, before you go on with your life, go to your phone s lock screen settings and disable the temporary password. Hope this helps. =-) Reply Sandy L on March 15, 2016 Judy, excuse me, but you re not understanding & therefore not replying to the problem people are having with the directory not found issue, while trying to use Android ADB commands.

Did I download something for x86 or make an error somewhere in the process? Judy, you are not responding to this problem! I think the updated versions of the downloads have changed the directory names & placements such that the command window instructions are incorrect. The issue is that your instructions direct that in the Command Prompt window, the OS should change directories to the root of C: (CD\\) then, change directories to android-sdk\\platform-tools (off the root of C:\\). I m an old DOS user . trust me, after installing both the Android Studio Bundle AND the required JDK version 7 (which your article doesn t mention), there IS NO directory under the root of C:\\ (or anywhere else it seems) called android-sdk nor is there, of course, one below it called platform-tools. I opened Android Studio, and at the top there was a msg about an update I clicked it took me to Updates are available for the Android SDK and TOOLS. Clicking update now button brought me to an option to Exit Studio and Launch SDK Manager. I opened the Android SDK Manager program which provides a whole list of packages (over 50 different individual files), ONE of which, under Tools says Android SDK Platform-tools. After selecting that package and several others that looked promising, downloading & installing them from Android SDK Manager, there was STILL NO android-sdk directory ANYWHERE on C:\\. There is a C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio but I failed to find the correct directory with which to launch your commands. I will continue to search, utilizing Android Studio, but I am disappointed that your article was not more specific. Reply Judy on March 16, 2016 Hi Sandy, Apologies for the article not being more specific and providing the details that are necessary to unlock an Android device.

Reply Judy on July 1, 2016 Hi Xavi, Thanks for your suggestion. Have you used it recently? =-) Reply pradeep on June 14, 2017 Hello Festus, By default, your alternate password should be the password associated with your Google account, Try with your google password. If not, you ll likely need to reset your device to factory default settings. But If you set up a Samsung account then find My Mobile service should be the first thing you try. Start by heading to this link https://findmymobile.samsung.com/ from any web browser, then log into your Samsung account and once you ve logged into your Samsung account, click the Lock my screen button in the left-hand pane. From here, enter a new PIN in the first field, then click the Lock button near the bottom of the screen. Within a minute or two, your lock screen password should be changed to the PIN you just entered. Let me know if that solves your problem!

Reply Albert Fifth on December 24, 2016 Subject: Bypass the PIN check of Samsung Galaxy S3 without root December 24, 2016 Hi, First impossible to register at your site. I try two time and nothing happen when finish to enter the information (name, email, etc.) I have an old Samsung S3 smartphone and I don t remember the PIN. The charging micro USB port no longer works. I won t use this smartphone because I have a brand new and I do not wish to have it repaired. The battery is charged to 100%. I would like to access one last time to recover my data and see all the applications that I used. My smartphone is not Root and I don t want Root it. Can I use one of the methods that you presented here without that I lose my data and my applications? I have no more access to my Google account or my Samsung account. In fact, I keep my passwords on a USB key and I lost the key. Method 7 looks nice, but does it have a Root smartphone to use it? Thank you and Happy Christmas! Reply Trevor on December 24, 2016 Not likely. If it s not rooted, the usb port is not functional and you can t access your accounts which could help you unlock it, and don t know the PIN, I think you don t have many options left. Reply Lady S on January 15, 2017 Hello I have a Samsung J3. It s prepaid. My phone service isn t active, because I have a different carrier and new phone. I m trying to get data off of this previous phone. I don t have a Samsung Account. Because the service isn t active, I can only lock and erase from my Google account, which does me no good because I need the data. I tried method 3, but when I type adb devices into the command prompt, no devices are listed. However, the Samsung KIES driver can sense the J3 phone. So I m trying Method 8 and it has me so confused! I downloaded aroma on my pc. How do I flash it? I don t know what this even means. I now how to boot into recovery mode. Please help! Reply Trevor on January 15, 2017 you can still hook the phone up to Wi-Fi to transfer information. Have you tried that? You can download apps and whatever else you might need over Wi-Fi. Reply Lady S on January 15, 2017 The phone is currently hooked up to our home wifi. How do I download apps when I cannot get past the lock screen. Reply Trevor on January 16, 2017 You didn t say where you were stuck. If you need to flash it to your phone, you will need to add it to your micro-SD card. From there you boot into recovery and can install the file from there. However, depending on the functionality you have on the screen, you might have issues seeing what you are doing. You can look at this article , it may help explain some things. You can also look up articles about rooting your phone as it may explain some of the terminologies you need. Whenever you are rooting, flashing things via recovery, or otherwise messing with the backend files of your phone, you need to be sure about what you are doing. If you aren t, you can mess things up with no option for repair. Take your time and learn about what you are doing so you are sure about it.

Reply Terri F. on March 2, 2017 Hello, I have a samsung s6 edge that I am locked out of. I looked online and it said that I could get into my phone using my google account or android device manager. I never got the prompt to input my google account information and adm let me create a password but it doesn t unlock the phone. Will any of these methods work for my phone? Info you may need: I have a macbook air, I would at the very least like to transfer the info from my phone to my laptop if a hard reset is the only option. I can only try a new password every 60 min. How many attempts do I have? Please advise. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Reply Trevor on March 2, 2017 what was your original security lock, was it a pin, password, or pattern? Patterns are not something you can remotely unlock. If if you didn t turn on debugging prior losing the password, it s hard to unlock. While the ADM and other things can work, the process can be trial and error. For my Nexus 5x, I had to reset the phone. What information do you need to get off the phone? A lot of things sync with your Google Account, see if the info you need synced. Reply Terri F. on March 2, 2017 FYI: I put in a pin number not a password.

I am trying Method 3, but I don t understand how to do Step 3: USB debugging needs to be enabled for this method to work as intended, but there is a way to circumvent this. If you boot into recovery mode, you can do these steps as normal without the need for USB debugging. However, your partition may need to be mounted, to do this: Go to Mounts and Storage in your recovery. Now mount /data. After you ve done this, you can proceed as if you have USB debugging enabled. My questions are: How do I access boot into recovery mode through my computer (my device is attached via USB)? What is partition ? Do I access the Mounts and Storage from my computer? If so, how do I locate this? **Also, I tried to see if I could skip Step 3 and proceed to Step 4. When I type: .\\adb shell (without the closed quotation marks), it produces this following output on another line: [email protected] :/ # So, on the same line, just after the # , I proceed to type: cd/data/data.com.android.providers.settings/databases. However, it returns an output stating not found . My question is: Should I be getting the [email protected] :/# as an output? If so, why is it that the following command I type, doesn t work? **The system is prompting me to type .\\adb instead of just adb Thanks in advance for the help! Reply megan on August 29, 2017 Hello! You need to do Step 3 before continuing on to Step 4. You should be booting into recovery mode from your mobile device, not from your computer. Mounts and Storage is access from your mobile device once you ve booted into recovery mode. Partition simply refers to how the various data stored in your phone is separated by Android OS.

And I m one of those people you mentioned who failed to register it with Samsung. I tried to unlock it from my computer using my Google account, but it says that, because I had a password set on it already, it won t allow me to reset it from the computer. I ll probably have to try one of your other methods above, but I just wanted to check to see if I was missing any step with Google. Thank you! Reply megan on October 31, 2017 Hi, Ken. I m afraid I don t quite understand your issue with Google. Did you mean that because there is a password on your device Google won t let you unlock it from your computer? Reply Ken on November 5, 2017 Yes, that s the problem. Reply megan on November 10, 2017 Got it. Did you try unlocking it via your Google account as described in Method 1? Reply Carrie on February 6, 2018 Hello. My 15 year old son died from suicide on Thanksgiving 2017. His Moto G 4g phone has a pin code, and it says after that it uses a fingerprint. Does that mean, even if I can unlock the pin code, I would need his fingerprint to unlock it? I m a very confused, grieving Momma, and just can t figure out how to get in this thing. I know there are answers in here. I need to find them. Any input or suggestions is greatly appreciated. Reply megan on February 6, 2018 Hi, Carrie. I m so sorry for your loss. The pin code unlock serves as an alternative to unlocking with a fingerprint, since fingerprint scanners can be prone to misread prints, so all you need is the pin code. Reply Carrie on February 6, 2018 thank you for such a fast response! ok, I already tried the Google Device Manager option. It doesn t work, since I assume we never activated that feature on his phone. method 1 His device won t let me use method 2 not my issue 3 I have no idea what rooted or unrooted means is there a way to tell? 4 see #3 5 Not a Samsung, it s a Moto G 4g 6 not an option 7 lock screen bypass app wondering if this is my only viable option? 8 I have no idea how to do this 9 not an option I m willing to try 3, 4, or 8, however I no nothing about tech and wouldn t know how to do any of these. Are there detailed instructions somewhere? And again, I don t know if the phone is rooted or not, or what that even means. Thank you so much for helping me! Reply megan on February 6, 2018 Hi, Carrie. The device is most likely not rooted, especially if it appears to be perfectly normal. Rooting is simply a way of working around some of the limitations placed on a device by the operating system to give the user more freedom to decide how they want the device to run and what operating system they want to use, but it voids the warranty. Very few 15 year olds would bother rooting their device. That said, it won t hurt to run the wrong series of ADB commands, so you can try each set just in case. A lock screen bypass app will only work if it s an older device. These apps won t work on Android versions 4.1 and newer. Android 4.1, which you may be more familiar with as Android Jellybean, came out in 2012, so unless it s a used device this probably isn t the right choice for you. I would recommend try options 3 and 4 before 8, because 8 is a much more involved process, but if 3 and 4 don t work out, I d be happy to help you through option number 8. One more possible solution would be to use Android Device Manager to unlock the device, but this isn t always an option depending on the device and settings. Simply follow steps 1 and 2 of option 9, but instead of clicking erase, click unlock if the option is there. Last, for a bit more info on rooting and ADB, you may want to check out our guides on the subjects: What Is ADB and How to Use It Secrets To Android Rooting Reply Carrie on February 7, 2018 Android device manager won t work on his phone. I went and downloaded Android Studio from the link shared, however, your instructions did not line up with what I was seeing.

Reply Rhyd3n on October 9, 2018 Method 4 worked for me since I had long ago rooted an old phone running 4.1.2 that I just got a replacement battery for.
