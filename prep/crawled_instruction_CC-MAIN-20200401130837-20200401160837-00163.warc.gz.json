For whatever reason be it an issue with the cable, overheating, or the iOS software some users have had luck fixing Touch ID activation problems by simply removing the iPhone or iPad from power or from the computer s USB port. Turn off your passcode via Turn Passcode Off in the Touch ID & Passcode area of the settings. When you disable the passcode, you re giving your device a chance to do a soft reset of the security settings. You ll have to re-enable the passcode again in order to use Touch ID, but during the process, things behind the scenes will do a sort of power cycle, which might be enough to fix Touch ID. Sign out of your Apple ID and then log back in. To do that, go to Settings , tap your name at the top, and then choose Sign Out at the bottom. Follow the on-screen steps and then log back in when that option is available. Contact Apple to learn about your repair options.
