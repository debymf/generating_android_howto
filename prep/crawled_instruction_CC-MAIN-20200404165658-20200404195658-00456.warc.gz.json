The issue I have is knowing that emails have arrived without having to scroll down the labels on the left side, looking for indicators of arrived, unread mail. I have left Skip the Inbox (Archive it) unchecked and had assumed that email would be delivered to both the labelled folder and Inbox. However, this is not happening and emails are delivered to labels without appearing in the Inbox. Any suggestions? Reply Akshata Shanbhag October 29, 2018 at 2:21 pm Alex, as long as you have left the Skip the Inbox and Mark as Read boxes unchecked, you should see the unread emails in the inbox and under the assigned label. If that isn't working, maybe you can try selecting the Always mark it as important option while creating the filter. Ensure that you've enabled Show markers under Settings > Inbox Reply Bill March 30, 2018 at 4:00 pm I appreciate the help I am getting but there are still unresolved questions in my mind. How do I select mail that is \"to,\" \"from, \" or \"cc\" to a specific address, or any combination of the three. I can see that if I put the address in the \"from\" box, it will select messages from that address. But how do I select messages that are sent TO an address other than mine? Or cc'ed to an address other than mine? T'bird offers 13 different criteria (subject, body, to, from, etc. etc.) and 6 different conditions (contains, doesn't contain, is, etc. etc.) I can enter multiple criteria and conditions and require that any of them or all of them be met. Gmail seems to permit only a few criteria (from, subject, does or doesn't contain, etc.) What is the point of the \"to\" box. It would seem to me that the only use for this would be if I have two e-mail addresses and want to sort in address A depending upon whether a copy had been sent to B. Reply Akshata Shanbhag March 31, 2018 at 4:53 am You can use the OR filter in the Has the words box like this: to:your_name@gmail.com OR to:another_name@gmail.com Any criteria that work in the search box should also work in the Has the words field in the filter. Since you get prompts for filter attributes in the search box as you start typing, it's easier to copy-paste conditions from there into the filter. Reply Bill Wilkes June 27, 2018 at 12:34 am Akshata, It has been a while since I started trying to use Gmail, and I have solved some of my problems with Thunderbird, so I am not so eager to move to Gmail. However, I have not given up, and I am continuing to try to do more.. I really miss the ability to have multiple criteria that Thunderbird provides, because making filters to sort out mail that is either from or to or cc'd to Joe, Sam, and Bob still seems to require a bunch of filters instead of just one. But my bigger problem is trying to get ANY filter to work as the filters in Thunderbird do. I would think that if I create a filter that says label any message from Bob@abc.net , \"Bob,\" that every new message that comes in from Bob would receive the Bob label. The messages just pile up in the inbox. The filter doesn't work until I open Gmail and \"edit\" the Bob filter. I don't actually change anything, but when I click on \"save\", all of the accumulated messages from Bob will be given the Bob label. I don't understand the purpose of filters if they only work when I have the Gmail app open. Reply Akshata Shanbhag June 28, 2018 at 1:33 pm That sounds strange. I haven't had trouble with Gmail filters the way you have described. Yes, they will still appear in the inbox if you don't choose the Archive checkbox while creating/editing the filter. But the labeling should work even if you don't have the app open. Anyway, since Thunderbird is working quite well for you, it makes sense to stick to that. Bill March 20, 2018 at 11:59 pm I suppose this would work if the instructions agreed with reality. ,1, I don't have a picture on my Gmail. 2 I do have a couple of avatars on the page, but there is no \"settings\" symbol near either of them. 3 there is a settings gear farther down the page, but clicking on it takes me to the tablet accounts page, where there is no link to \"filters and blocked addresses\". There is no link to anything with the word \"filter\" in it. Reply Akshata Shanbhag March 21, 2018 at 12:09 pm Hi Bill, which device are you using? Reply Bill March 23, 2018 at 2:23 am That was an Android device because I am trying to minimize my use of Windows. I did discover later that the instructions you gave DO work when one opens Gmail in Windows. I hope when I finally get used to it, I will find the same ability to filter mail that I have in Thunderbird. It appears that I can, but what I liked about Thunderbird filters is that you can select several criteria and then whether the mail must meet any of them or all of them. E.g., only messages from Joe with an attachment or only messages before or after a certain date. Reply Bill March 23, 2018 at 3:17 am I have another question. In Thunderbird, my filters generally move a message to a specific folder. Messages from Joe go to the Joe folder. In GMail, all I can do is to apply a label or a category. I don't understand categories, but I do see familiar folders in the choice of labels. However, the message is now in both the folder and the inbox. Does \"skip inbox\" PLUS \"add label A\" mean \"move the message to folder A?\" Move the message seems so much clearer - I have no idea why I would want a bunch of labels scattered among the 200 messages in my inbox. Also, I want all messages from Joe's Glass company AND all messages from anyone with glass in the subject OR in the body OR both to be moved to the glass folder. I've tried putting \"glass\" in the \"from box, in the \"subject\" box , in the \"has words\" box, but nothing seems to work. Do I have to spell out Joe's Glass Co@abc.com , or can I just put in Joe or Joe's glass or Joe's Glass Co? Also, there is a box for \"subject\" and another for \"has the words.\" Does the subject have to be exact? Or can it simply be required to include a word? What does the \"has the words\" box mean. Does that mean has the words in the body? in the subject? either? Take a look at Thunderbird and how to create a filter - it is quite transparent and easy. I never once had a problem trying to create a filter, but I'm just groping around with Gmail. Reply Akshata Shanbhag March 25, 2018 at 2:36 pm Bill, in Gmail labels sort of double up as folders and tags. \"Skip inbox\" + \"Add label A\" does move the email to the folder A as you guessed. Once it does, you will the see the message when you open folder A, but you won't see the label \"A\" itself in the message list. You'll see it if you open the email. Now, if you leave the message in the inbox and add the label \"A\" to it, you'll see the email in the inbox and folder A, but in the inbox it will be labeled \"A\", and in the folder A it will be labeled \"inbox\". I guess this approach comes in handy when you view emails the All Mail folder, which contains sent messages, drafts, and trash items apart from incoming messages. Categories make it easier to filter personal messages from automated ones, messages sent to a mailing list, etc. For example, if you get a password reset email, you're sure to find it under the Updates category. Marketing emails show up under Promotions and Facebook/Twitter messages show up under Social. As for creating the filters you mention, the From field is reserved for a sender's email address. The To field is for an email address that belongs to you i.e. if you check multiple accounts from Gmail. This is why putting in \"glass\" in the From/To field won't work. You'll need to create two separate filters here: one where the From field contains the email Joe's Glass Co@abc.com and the second where you put \"glass\" in the Has the words field. The Subject field is only for the subject and it doesn't have to be exact i.e. it can simply include a word or a set of words in a particular sequence. The Has the words box filters words that are either in the subject and/or body of the email. Thunderbird does make filter creation easy, but really, it's not so bad in Gmail either once you get the hang of it. Julija January 29, 2018 at 9:51 am Hello, I do not understand how fill in the box Filter \"has the words\"?? If I write one word - it works, but how do I separate a few words? Using a space, comma or dash ... - does not work. Gmail filters out only the first word. Please help me. Thank you. Reply Akshata Shanbhag January 30, 2018 at 3:06 am You can filter multiple words or phrases with AND/OR operators. If you type in a few words without using one of these operators, Gmail considers the sequence as an exact phrase and searches for it specifically as it appears. Reply Anonymous April 14, 2016 at 11:08 pm \"To Auto-delete Emails That Just Don t Quit\" That is only a partial solution. You are moving the clutter from Inbox to Trash. Google should add an option that if an email matches the filter, it is spam. Reply Akshata Shanbhag April 16, 2016 at 2:40 am That would have been convenient, but for now we're stuck with blocking senders to mark their mails as spam or auto-deleting mails. The latter is a partial solution. I prefer it because I don't use the All Mail label much, so the deleted emails stay out of sight and I can empty the trash once in a while. Reply Anonymous April 14, 2016 at 6:09 pm I don't understand \"inbox zero.\" I keep all my messages - every one I've ever gotten over the last 25 years, in my primary inbox. I can mark them important if I need to, and the chronology of when they were delivered helps me assemble a journal of my day. Reply Akshata Shanbhag April 16, 2016 at 2:42 am I guess it depends on how you see your inbox. You see it as a sort of journal, while people like myself who maintain an empty inbox see it as a to-do list.
