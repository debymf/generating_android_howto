I followed exactly and there is no add to home screen option since updating to the latest iOS 13. Reply Ben Stegner February 26, 2020 at 3:30 pm I just walked through these steps again on iOS 13.3.1 to make sure, and it works exactly as I wrote above. What specific part isn't working for you? Reply EBF February 9, 2020 at 2:04 pm Has the behavior of things added to the home screen changed?? My old saved items open in their own app window. The latest I just did (first since iOS 13 update), opens in Safari. Frustrating. Reply Josh January 25, 2020 at 1:53 pm Add to home screen option is no longer there with newest update? How am I create short cut now? Reply Drwalther February 23, 2020 at 10:15 pm if you find out, I sure would like to know too!! Reply Ben Stegner February 26, 2020 at 3:31 pm I just tested this again on the latest version of iOS and it still works for me. I would have to see a screenshot of it to figure out what's up. Reply Ellen Falk January 11, 2020 at 11:36 am At the bottom of the screen you ll see an icon depicting an arrow that looks like it s trying to get away from a square. This represents the never-ending struggle between the pursuant rectangular form and chased arrowhead. It also represents tapping a button to perform an action, which is more applicable in this case. So tap this button. If you managed to tap that button successfully, you ll have a few options. The one you want to tap is Add to Home Screen . So do that. Reply Marion Richards February 26, 2020 at 12:41 pm Option is no longer available since latest iOS update Reply", "url": "https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/add-website-shortcuts-iphone-home-screen/", "index": 1}
