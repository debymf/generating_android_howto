Once downloaded, open the browser. Type https://m.youtube.com into the search bar to find the YouTube site. Search for the video you want to play on YouTube within the browser.

The top of your search bar will say https://m.youtube.com. Play the video, and once the video starts, switch to another app, or put your screen into sleep mode. The video will stop. Swipe to find the music player, and check to see if the title of your video is showing there. Sometimes iOS defaults the media player to your music library in the music player, rather than the video. If this happens, simply go back to the YouTube video in Opera or Dolphin, and press play again to clear out the music player so that it defaults to YouTube. Once the title of your video shows up in the control center, press play to let the video play.
