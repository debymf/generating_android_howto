I get no options to reset my PIN or Microshaft password. What now? Reply mike sea October 17, 2018 at 8:16 am i have the latest version of win10 but I don't have any password reset option other than using usb drive, I click on that it opens the wizard, but then says this is not a password key, then says it needs to be set up first, well if I cant log in, how in the world can I make the usb password rest ??? it seems quite silly that it doesn't prompt you to make it right there. there is no option to send to phone or email like your article suggests. completely useless and still locked out even though I know 100% what I made the password to. just keeps saying wrong password. all it gives me is my hint which actually is my password, but it continues to say wrong password and I cant log on.
