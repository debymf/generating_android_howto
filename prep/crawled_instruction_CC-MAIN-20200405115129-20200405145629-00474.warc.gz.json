Reply Kannon Y June 11, 2018 at 2:39 pm Hi, it's possible to create a backup of your phone by using the Android SDK, but it's a huge PITA. (Google for Android SDK Full Backup.) The easiest way is to install the custom recovery and perform the backup through the recovery. Unfortunately, that carries with it the risk of bricking your phone, which is why we make backups in the first place. Reply Thomas June 12, 2018 at 3:21 am Thanks, Kannon... I'll look at SDK, I'm in no huury (yet), so sometimes PITA is educational enough ?

Reply Kannon Yamada May 7, 2018 at 12:02 am I can't say for certain what the issue is. Would you happen to be on some sort of limited data plan in a country outside of the US? I do know this though: Chrome can be configured to use a proxy. It's called mobile data compression. If a proxy is enabled and Chrome is the only app still working, that means there is some other issue with the way your device connects to the internet. Malware is known to redirect internet traffic, except in cases where encrypted proxies are used. But I could be totally wrong. Have you tried a factory reset? My advice is this: try booting up in Safe Mode and see what happens.

Have you tried safe mode yet? If you are getting error messages and an automatic reboot BEFORE you can even operate the device, it may be due to malware. Normally, I would recommend a factory reset, but in this case, you may first want to try booting into recovery mode and then pulling the files -- although that may not be possible.

Reply Goku March 29, 2017 at 4:27 am My apps either quit or restart when ever i connect or disconnect the physical keyboard (i have an RCA pro 10) Reply Kannon Y April 1, 2017 at 10:00 pm That sounds like a hardware issue. Although it doesn't sound like a hardware issue at all. The RCA Pro 10 (Viking or something else?) is designed to work with a keyboard. There may be an application that's causing this. The only way I know of to troubleshoot this issue would be to perform a factory reset and then attach the keyboard. If it continues killing apps, then I would guess that the device is somehow defective. Reply goku April 2, 2017 at 12:58 am actually I've found the issue is a mix of hardware and software the actual hardware issue is known that is unsteady contact between the tablet and the pins from the case or other wise unsteady connection between the keyboard and tablet ... that's the hardware side the software side is if an app doesn't have a programed response to a change in keyboard state androids default behavior is to kill and restart the app so from the app programmer side the issue would be solved adding one or two lines of code give or take but I don't know if there's an end user solution aside perhaps from buying a new keyboard case Reply Kannon Yamada April 2, 2017 at 1:16 am That's an excellent hardware analysis, thank you for sharing. It sounds then as if the hardware is defective? RCA tablets from Walmart, like the Galileo, IIRC carry a two year warranty. I took a closer look at the pins on the RCA tablets -- they are really flimsy compared to the pogo pins on more expensive devices. It wouldn't surprise me at all if this were the problem. I think there's an option in Android for controlling keyboard behavior. You can configure it to behave differently when a keyboard is connected. You see this option sometimes on devices with physical keyboards. The first time I saw it show up was in Android 5 or 6 IIRC. You might have some luck changing these settings. Shedrack February 24, 2017 at 7:08 pm My phone is TECNO H3 Reply Sheila Strickland February 21, 2017 at 3:22 pm Since the latest (Jan 2017) system update, any app I download that requires internet connection will not work and gives me the following message. \"An internal service failure occurred. This can be caused by a lack of network connectivity. Please make sure you have a good network connection.\" When I check the network connection appears to be fine and working for all apps prior to the update. Have you run into this issue and do you know a solution? Reply Kannon February 24, 2017 at 3:31 pm Hi Sheila, I have run into this issue and normally it means your internet connection is the culprit. Are you connected to a Wi-Fi network or over a mobile connection? Sometimes your phone may behave differently following a system update. I normally advise attempting a factory reset as it will save you a lot of time troubleshooting all the various causes of this problem. However, there's a good chance that the problem can continue following a factory reset. Try the following before using the nuclear option (factory reset): * Restart your device. * Try disconnecting (forgetting the network) from and reconnecting to your Wi-Fi network -- make sure you have the right network password. * You can also try removing your Google account and then re-adding it. But unless you're familiar with this process, you may want to do a factory reset. * There's also the option of clearing the caches on the Google Play Store, Google Play Services, and Google Framework -- but unless you're familiar with the process, you are better off with a factory reset. Reply Lori February 16, 2017 at 4:37 am For the last month, I've been having a problem with my CM cleaner and other cleaner. I have full Norton coverage, plus the anti-virus software that came with my phone, so I should be covered all around, SAFE PHONE..any way my point is every time I try to clean my phone junk it will remove so much and then the screen goes black, then to my home screen, it does this on all cleaners, sometimes on Google or while playing a game. I installed a different Anti-virus and cleaner, it says no threats found,But it has this on the same screen. Virus DB:d3fXLgJTa90nqYVy..what does this mean? If you can tell me I would greatly appreciate it. Thank You for your time Reply Kannon February 24, 2017 at 3:25 pm Hi Lori, I wouldn't use any of those anti-virus applications. Google Play Store apps are, overwhelmingly, safer than downloading and installing apps that you find online. In fact, some of those anti-virus programs actually are viruses in disguise. Try uninstalling them. If you continue to experience problems, factory reset your device. That particular code is a data-base entry for a virus. It could be a false positive, a phony anti-virus program, or a real entry. But if you download apps exclusively from the Play Store, then it's probably a phone anti-virus program.

Any help would be appreciated thanks. Reply Kannon February 15, 2017 at 6:33 pm Hi Patrick, I'm not familiar with that particular device, but I'm assuming it's a white label version of the Android-based set-top-box that's circulating on Amazon. Does it have an Amlogic S905 processor? I ask because many games will not run properly (no matter what you do) on some of the lesser-supported processors. Basically, unless you have a Qualcomm processor, whether or not games run correctly is a game of dice. Much of the reason why is because games are so resource intensive. Many of them are not coded in Java, for this reason. But if they're not written in Java, that means each game's processor much be supported by the app. I suspect that the only way to get the games to run correctly is to request support from the developer. Considering the sheer number of Android boxes based on Amlogic processors out there, the devs might be receptive to any requests. Amlogic processors are, as I understand it, completely open source. In theory, that should make it easier for developers to get their games running on the platform. Reply Kevin February 3, 2017 at 7:20 am Hi, I have a problem with the touchscreen controls malfunctioning frequently when I play games on my tablet. Nothing I try seems to help usually or doesn't help for long. I clear the catche, data, delete junk, boost ram, restart, and curse. It works best when I first turn on the tablet and seems to get worse the longer I play. Makes me think it's a heat issue. Any ideas? Reply Kannon Yamada February 6, 2017 at 11:41 am Touchscreen problems were very common on devices such as the OnePlus One, Nexus 7, and other devices. These were hardware issues that weren't correctable using software or firmware tweaks. Can I ask what device you have? It could also be a sign of a defective device. Reply Kevin February 6, 2017 at 1:44 pm I have an Irulu X10 tablet, very inexpensive but I really like it mostly. It does a lot better on some games than others. Reply Kannon February 6, 2017 at 1:57 pm It sounds like the digitizer isn't properly isolated, which leads to sensitivity issues. This is similar to the issues that the Nexus 7 2013 had, where the touchscreen issues would only show up in some games that required lots of tapping on the screen. You can always try a factory reset or other options, but those should not correct the problem. I'm sorry about that. However, I totally agree that China-branded/designed tablets offer a great alternative to those from large US/Taiwan corporations. You get a lot of bang for your buck if you know the brands. Haz January 24, 2017 at 6:54 am Hi my friend is using Asus then after he has formatted his phone he still have virus can you help? Reply Kannon January 26, 2017 at 10:06 am What have you tried so far? The surest method of resolving malware is the factory reset. However, you can also navigate to the app menu in Settings and remove the apps that you don't use. Most malware hides itself from the app drawer. But I can't think of any malware that can hide within the Settings menu.

My phone is 1 yr old Reply Kannon Y January 21, 2017 at 9:44 am I'm not familiar with this issue. Does your phone disconnect from the cellular tower or the WiFi? What model of phone is it? In general, issues like this can be either hardware, firmware, or software. If it's software, a factory reset SHOULD be able to fix the issue. If the factory reset doesn't work then it's either firmware or hardware. If the hardware is faulty, there's nothing you can do and must return the device under warranty. If the firmware is the cause, the carrier might be able to fix the issue, but your best bet is almost always to RMA (return) the device. Your credit card almost always adds an additional year of warranty to your card: //www.makeuseof.com/tag/get-money-back/ Reply Pravin January 8, 2017 at 3:51 pm I m having a problem on my samsung galaxy note 5 that i cant use any security option of setting nothing works like passcode,pin,fingerprint.

If there's any damage to the display components on the motherboard, it means no matter what screen you use, the device will remain broken. In theory, you can attempt to troubleshoot this yourself by trying to connect to an external display (unlikely, as you would need to somehow navigate multiple menus in order to switch to an external display). But the most direct solution is to replace the device entirely. Most display components are non-replaceable. That means once they break, there are no DIY means to repair the device. I'm very sorry.

Reply Kannon Yamada August 22, 2016 at 5:13 pm The problem with root is that it tampers with system files, which can have unpredictable effects on your device. It also dramatically increases the chance that you will at some point in the future need to perform a factory reset. You may, or may not, want to undo root and see if that fixes the problem. However, undoing root oftentimes causes an unbootable device. So you are definitely right that using a log analysis is the correct course of action. For logs, I use CatLog. It's not any different than the other log-catching apps out there. Basically, run the app, cause the crash, and then check the log. It may or may not catch the crash, depending on how sudden it is. Another option is to use the Android Debug Bridge and the development kit. I use this method more often than CatLog (because I've rid myself of root). It's pretty easy to do too, it just requires a fairly large download (Android Studio). Here are the instructions: https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/logcat.html Reply Vicki August 16, 2016 at 6:19 pm My Android tablet is all of a sudden in a mirror like image and I can't figure out how to reset it Reply Kannon Yamada August 22, 2016 at 5:01 pm I believe that means you've enabled developer options and enabled the RTL (right to left) handling mode. It's designed for single, left-handed operation. You should be able to resolve this by going to Settings --> Developer Options --> and de-checking the RTL mode. Reply prem raj August 13, 2016 at 7:58 am my android had suddenly stopped working. a light is blinking but it doesnt displays my screen as how many times after rebooting my mobile also. so, could you please find any solution for my problem Reply Kannon Yamada August 13, 2016 at 6:02 pm What model of phone is it and is it modified? Can you relate what you've done already? I suggest as a first line of attack: hold the power button down for 30 seconds (or until it shows signs of life). Reply Prem raj August 14, 2016 at 10:02 am Reliance's lyf water 7model, no modifications.just while using WiFi suddenly android stopped working. It only displays a wallpaper on the screen.ibturned on safe mode but no use.several time's. Irebooted the mobile but also no use of it. Could u find solution for this Reply Kannon Yamada August 22, 2016 at 5:58 pm I can't even imagine what's going on. If the wallpaper displays, but the apps don't, that could be any number of failures. Have you tried entering the recovery mode or the bootloader? Safe Mode is something I would normally have suggested, since the phone appears to be mostly booting up on its own. The Android boot process, depending on the version of the OS, tends to follow a basic formula: https://community.nxp.com/docs/DOC-102546 It sounds like it's not properly compiling applications though. I would normally advise a factory reset, but this could be a fairly serious problem. Reply Anonymous August 12, 2016 at 2:05 pm For the last few days, every time I take my phone off charge, it makes an audible announcement saying how much battery life I have left. This is really annoying as I often take my phone off charge when I wake up and my wife is still sleeping. I can't find a setting to switch this off. I have a Moto G running Android 5.1 Reply Kannon Yamada August 13, 2016 at 6:03 pm Hi Alex, it might be an accessibility setting (which is in the settings menu). Do you remember making any changes to that particular part of the phone? Reply simon August 10, 2016 at 3:41 pm everytime I load media on my phone (gallery/whatsapp etc) it grinds to a halt Am using OnePlus 2 Reply Kannon Yamada August 11, 2016 at 7:39 pm That can be almost anything, but a good rule of thumb with smartphones is to never overload the eMMC module. Once you've filled up 75% of the drive's capacity, it will begin slowing down. The best fix is to clear out around a quarter of the capacity and let it sit for 24 hours in airplane mode. Or consider a factory reset.

Reply Rojie August 9, 2016 at 8:46 am Hello, newly installed Pokemon Go crashes everytime I input my birthday 3/8/1992. please help. Reply Kannon Yamada August 9, 2016 at 12:49 pm It might be that your phone doesn't have enough RAM to run the program. Pokemon Go requires 2GB of RAM to run properly. I have heard about people getting it to run on 1GB, but I'm not sure if that's entirely true. Your phone has 512MB of RAM, which means you have 1/4 the amount required. Unfortunately, unless I've misread about your phone's specs, it appears you won't be able to play it until you upgrade. Reply Visbyper July 24, 2016 at 8:22 am I have a Samsung S6. randomly it flips beetween the view of all open program and the app I use Have made a factory reset, but the problem i still there. Reply Kannon Yamada July 24, 2016 at 4:04 pm I've never heard of this issue before. The \"view of all open program\" is sometimes referred to as the multi-tasking screen. It shouldn't open unless the user has opened it. If it's opening by default, there's a possibility that it's being caused by a rogue app. Have you tried booting the device in safe mode?

I have also tried taking a screen shot of the problem I'm talking about, but the screenshot just shows the normal display. Any idea what else I can do before sending it in? Reply Kannon Yamada May 28, 2016 at 1:42 am I'm not sure what is causing that issue, but it sounds like a hardware problem. It might be that the GPU is faulty since it's not drawing the screen correctly. But basically if a factory reset doesn't fix the issue, the problem is most likely hardware related. And smartphones aren't totally user-serviceable. So it might have to be sent back. There are a few option that technicians use to attempt repair of problems like this, but I'm doubtful it would work. I've heard of fresh factory images being pushed via USB to the phone. If the company that makes your phone offers factory images, you could try that -- but the safer options is to just return it.

A PC, though, is surrounded by metal and pretty much impervious to the radiation emitted by smartphones. The FCC should inspect all devices capable of emitting wireless frequencies for possible problems such as this. This is definitely not my field of expertise though. Electronics are really, really complicated and almost anything is possible. There are also law enforcement agencies that use devices known as \"Stingrays\" which are portable cellular towers, which probably aren't vetted by the FCC and may cause the problems you've encountered. But if you are really concerned, try picking up a cheap prepaid phone and see if it causes the same problems. jared February 26, 2016 at 3:05 am has any one had the problem of the phone rebooting if its not in use or on charge ? mine does when it goes into screen lock for about 5 minutes it will keep rebooting . is there a fix for this i can do at home ?

I advocate a factory reset, as some malware on older Android handsets can alter your system directory. If you'd prefer not to factory reset, use the Safe Mode method. Search the internet for your particular handset, and include \"Safe Mode\". You should find instructions on how to enter Safe Mode. When in Safe Mode you can remove the offending apps. Just go to Settings --> Apps --> Downloaded and start killing apps you recently downloaded.

What version of Android is it on and what version of Android is it upgrading to? Did you root your device in any way? Did you use a custom ROM? Do you have a custom recovery installed? You might be able to resolve the issue with a factory reset, but if you've modified your OS in any way, that might not be the first option you should consider. The Acore process is related to a number of system functions. I've experienced it before and have resolved it by wiping data for my contacts. Just go to apps --> all --> contacts and then wipe data.

Reply Kannon Yamada August 9, 2015 at 2:32 pm Have you tried wiping the cache partition or DALVIK cache from the recovery or bootloader? Every Android phone is different. Some can have a recovery preboot environment or they can have a bootloader. Sometimes the bootloader is the same as a recovery. It's all dependent on your manufacturer's whims.

The frequency is about 5-6 times a minute . You can imagine how disturbing it is , not to mention the battery drain ! I've tried several things like volume up+power off to wipe cache , though nothing seems to work ! I'm running an old android version ( 2.3.6 ) . I would appreciate any help . Thanks ! Reply Kannon Yamada August 1, 2015 at 11:14 pm Have you tried turning vibrate off? Reply Anonymous August 2, 2015 at 3:17 pm The vibration is off. Reply Kannon Yamada August 2, 2015 at 6:37 pm If this occurs following a factory reset, then it is a hardware issue. Any problems that persists through a factory reset is a hardware problem (or firmware). You can try adjusting settings, but the phone is so old that you are better off upgrading. Anonymous August 2, 2015 at 6:41 pm Thank you for your time , sir ! Anonymous July 14, 2015 at 7:18 pm I have samsung galaxy note 2 gt n7100.. I try some of any apps to root my device but still all not working in my android device..always showin what whould I do to gain an root access to my devicde? Reply Anonymous July 14, 2015 at 7:19 pm always showing UNABLE TO ROOT.. thats it. Reply Kannon Yamada July 14, 2015 at 7:20 pm Samsung devices can be really tricky to root. The root process is determined by the hardware -- specifically the kind of system-on-a-chip (SoC). If you're using an international edition of the Galaxy Note 2, then you may have an Exynos chip, instead of a Qualcomm. In this case, you'd need to find a root method that's specific to Exynos on the Note 2. And then there's all kinds of additional caveats and barriers -- on top of that. Reply Anonymous June 29, 2015 at 9:04 am I have Galaxy A-5 , When we resart the phone It shows old version of play store result error - \"unfortunately google stopped -google.ap\" like that ,when we install new version thru Xender..It starts working. ..pls advise permanent solution , when our battery washed off..we need to again install latest version of play store..moreover many times its screen goes black..here only we need to reboot the mobile Reply Kannon Yamada June 29, 2015 at 11:19 pm Did you try any of the tips outlined in this article? Reply sd May 24, 2015 at 5:49 pm My phone is samsung galaxy A5. Back arrow button on the bottom right corner of the phone gets pressed automatically. This makes the screen goes back until it reaches home screen. This happens when I browse , play games and videos as well as when texting . I did factory reset thrice and also manufacturer again reset the software twice . manfacturer also advised to change SIM and scratchguard. But the phone does the malfunction even without SIM. The problem doesn't occur always but frequently it happens. Please advise Reply Kannon Y May 24, 2015 at 9:36 pm Sorry for your troubles. When a factory reset doesn't resolve the issue, this is almost always caused by a hardware failure. It can be something as simple as liquid or something conductive inadvertently activating that part of the screen or it can be a failing digitizer. There's a handful of other things that you can try, but none of them will likely work. RMA/return is probably the most time efficient use of your time. Please contact customer service and let them know that you've already tried a factory reset. That should pretty much clear up the options they have available and they'll probably give you an RMA number. Good luck. Reply habe May 22, 2015 at 5:57 pm I tap to reset and than show me erasing,after that i wait 2 hours and still wont load Reply Kannon Y May 22, 2015 at 6:02 pm If factory reset doesn't resolve the problem then the device will probably need to be returned to the manufacturer for repair. However, if you've installed a custom ROM, you need to perform a factory reset according to the instructions provided by the ROM creator. Reply Arjun May 17, 2015 at 1:24 pm Now my phone is continuously restarted. What can I do? When I press vol down button and power button together I can see factory mode. But there is some test options and reboot option only. ?? Reply Kannon Y May 17, 2015 at 5:34 am Safe Mode varies by device. It's also mentioned within this article: //www.makeuseof.com/tag/dealing-with-system-problems-in-android-safe-mode-factory-reset-and-restoring-backups/ Have you tried accessing your device's Bootloader or recovery mdoe? It's usually accessible by powering on the device while holding the power button and the volume down button. You do not want download mode, which is accessed through a similar key combo hold on boot. Reply Arjun May 17, 2015 at 5:18 am Sorry sir. It is kitikat 4.4. And even I can't enter into settings. How can I do factory reset or activate safe mode?

The apps and even the system. I cant perform an action in my phone cause the 'Unfortunately/Unresponsive' message kept on showing. Does my phone need to repair or something? x Anyway thank you so much for the reply. Reply Kannon Y March 17, 2015 at 7:30 pm The bootloader is a preboot environment where you can factory reset your phone without having to actually load the phone's operating system. From the bootloader you can sometimes access a recovery mode or recovery the operating system. http://www.addictivetips.com/mobile/what-is-bootloader-and-how-to-unlock-bootloader-on-android-phones-complete-guide/ You would need to Google your specific phone and \"how to enter bootloader\" in order to get details. Most devices include some method of recovering the device from the bootloader (or recovery mode, which is accessible from the bootloader). Reply Kat Carta March 16, 2015 at 8:08 pm What should i do if i 'Factory reset' my phone and then some sort of message flash on a the screen and says ' data wipe failed' ??? Please tell me what should i do. My mom's gonna kill me. And additon when i turned on my phone, the data that i used to be deleted was there again. And again some sort of annoying pop-up message came out. 'Unfortunately' something blah blah has stop. Can someone help me fix it. My phone is HUAWEI ASCEND Y300. Thank you. Please response. Reply Kannon Y March 16, 2015 at 8:36 pm Factory resets sometimes fail. Normally, you want your device plugged in while it's resetting. You can also perform a factory reset from the bootloader -- this is more reliable, but might cause you issues. Can you list what service has stopped? There's a lot of causes for these kinds of things -- but oftentimes you can resolve the issue by wiping the cache of the app/service that has failed. It's the same process as the Google Play crashing fix, up at the top. Reply Kannon Y March 16, 2015 at 8:36 pm What I meant by \"it's the same process\": You would need to wipe the cache/data of the service that is crashing (not Google Play).

Please do give me the solution :) Reply Kannon Y March 16, 2015 at 7:59 pm There's a lot of different fixes, like properly setting time and date, region, etc... but the easiest way is to just perform a factory reset. Here's some of the other fixes: Reply Silverlokk March 16, 2015 at 8:36 am I was getting Low on Storage warnings. Found that Google Books was storing downloaded books in my internal SD storage, and I can't find a way to move them to the SD card. Had about 500MB of books, had to remove some of them, which meant I'd have to be online to read them, but that's not a major hassle. Still, I wish that Books would let me select the SD card as storage for downloaded books As an aside, a few of those books are from MUo.com :) Reply Kannon Y March 16, 2015 at 7:49 pm Google Services are notorious for doing things like this. They basically hate it when we use local storage rather than cloud storage. I hope it's not saving the files to the system directory. That would be simply vindictive. Reply B.Sasidharan March 17, 2015 at 4:13 pm From the very begining when an incomming call receives whetger that call no: is already saved in my phone or not the caller no: wll automatically display in my Nexus 5 phone.But only after I downloaded the lollipop os the display of incomming call in the monotor can't be seen.I can here only the ring tone.If I want to contact the caller I have to press the battery key, then touch the phone key where three options showes where I touch the middle one, then only I can hear the caller sound& identity.This will take a lot of waste of time. Reply B.Sasidharan March 16, 2015 at 7:37 am Display of incomming call is not showing in the monitor automatically. My phone is Google Nexus 5 Reply Kannon Y March 16, 2015 at 7:48 pm Is it totally blank or does just the number show? If it's just the number, I think this is actually an issue with Google Contacts, I believe. If the number differs even slightly from the one you've got in your contacts, it won't display the name. Reply Fik of borg March 14, 2015 at 11:35 pm It is just me, or all embedded videos point to the same \"How to enable safe mode on android\"? I seem to recall this happening on other articles here on MUO. Reply Kannon Y March 16, 2015 at 7:45 pm It's working for me. I'm not sure what the issue is. Have you tried restarting the computer? Reply Fik of Borg March 16, 2015 at 8:05 pm Seems to be a chrome issue, probably something with the user profile. Worked fine in Firefox without restarting the computer. Thanks for your answer! Reply Chinmay S March 14, 2015 at 11:24 am Google Play doesn't allow me to download apps even if my phone has more than enough space. Even if I have 400 MB of free space, it won't allow me to download a 20 MB file. I have to run Clean Master to remove junk files which has no impact on free space whatsoever and then I am able to download it. And these are just Android problems, there are many more problems with Android phones. For example, not getting a single update on $700-$800 flagship phone in the last 2 years. The solution to these problems is buy an iPhone. Problem SOLVED. Reply Kannon Y March 16, 2015 at 7:44 pm I would use CCleaner rather than Clean Master. They were once the best cleaning app around, but then started doing things that were not acceptable with customer data. It sounds as if you have an international (Exynos) Samsung Galaxy S4. Samsung was notorious for pumping out different versions of the same device. They are the absolute worst company to buy from. There's more reliable companies out there right now -- the Nexus series probably being among the best. iPhone does solve many of the problems. Even so, I'd much rather have a $350 Nexus 5 over a $640 iPhone 6. The problem with Android phones is that apps can save data to locations with limited space. A lot of music apps cache data in directories with limited space. And then they never run cleanup operations on those locations. I recommend using DiskUsage to locate the places where data is piling up and then uninstalling the app responsible. Reply Tom March 17, 2015 at 2:49 am Sounds like you got ripped off with your $800 phone. Don't blame the system for your poor purchases. Not getting updates isn't an \"Android problem\"... it's a greedy cell phone carrier problem. Just look at how long is taken the carriers to roll out Lollipop. Also, I had most of Apples \"new\" features on my Nexus 4 already........ back in 2012. Reply Victor March 14, 2015 at 2:13 am Hmm... nope.
