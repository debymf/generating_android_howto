Launch the Prime Video app and log in to your account on your mobile device. Choose the movie you want to watch and press Play on the app. Tap once on the playing video, and you will see the AirPlay icon in the upper right corner. Swipe upward from the bottom of your iPad screen in earlier versions of iOS (or down from the top right corner in iOS 11 and later) to display the Control Center , where you can also find the AirPlay control. Tap the AirPlay button, which resembles an upward-pointing triangle with a rectangle that looks like a television. If you don't see the AirPlay button, enable it first and then try again. The steps for turning on AirPlay are similar on the iPhone and on the iPad . Choose the Apple TV you want to stream the movie to (if you have more than one) and tap its name in the dialog box. The Amazon Prime movie or TV show should now be playing on your Apple TV.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/watch-amazon-prime-video-on-apple-tv-4047602", "index": 1}
