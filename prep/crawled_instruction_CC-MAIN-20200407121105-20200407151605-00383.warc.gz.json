I really hate mobile Facebook for the copy/paste issue, and, you know... a few other things. But it seems to me that I've been just blind and couldn't see that \"Desktop Site\" in a fairly small print at the bottom of the option column. So... thanks, again! Now I found what I was looking for! Yaaaay! :) John hutton June 7, 2012 at 10:59 am Go to fb safari site,go to the left hand section ie newsfeed,messages and chat column,scroll right to the bottom and click the small print \"desktop site\" it works fine there on iPhone 4s Lizzie June 22, 2012 at 2:51 am Thanks!!! Your advise helped!! :) Jewie May 21, 2012 at 9:02 pm Also you can go to desktop site on top right with safari Facebook and then you can do it but the page lags a bit on desktop site Elber June 5, 2012 at 10:36 pm I know right this dont let me copy and paste on facebook thats so dumb Jewie May 21, 2012 at 9:00 pm Its random, very few rare occasions it let's you do it, I just keep pressing the text an sometimes it comes up but be carefull not to tap again as it goes off :( Heray Farzan May 17, 2012 at 9:53 am I had the same problem and I tried Opera and it worked Carol May 6, 2012 at 4:13 pm This is so very annoying and Facebook need to allow this on their app.it does not work on the app nor via safari ...so much for convenience on the go!
