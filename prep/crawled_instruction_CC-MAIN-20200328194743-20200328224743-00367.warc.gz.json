Then, turn on the Content & Privacy Restrictions toggle switch. Set a restrictions passcode , which is a 4-digit password that locks certain functions of the iOS device. Choose a passcode you'll remember, but don't share it with people you don't want making purchases. If they know your passcode, they can re-enable in-app purchases. Enter the passcode twice to set it. If you're turning off in-app purchasing because a child uses the iPhone, make sure the passcode isn't the same as the one you use to unlock the device. Tap iTunes & App Store Purchases > In-app Purchases > Don't Allow . If you change your mind and later want to restore the ability to make in-app purchases, come back to this screen and turn off the Content & Privacy Restrictions toggle switch.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/manage-turn-off-in-app-purchases-2000112", "index": 0}
