Tap the song to start playing it. Tap the play bar (located at the bottom of the screen) to reveal the full-screen music playback interface for that song. Tap the three dots ( ... ) at the bottom of the screen. In the menu that appears, tap Create Station . The app creates the new station, although nothing on the screen lets you know this. After the first song plays, or if you skip it, the next song you hear is from the new radio station you just created. The app selects other songs similar to the one you chose for the station to play. As your station plays, scroll down the full-screen music playback interface to see the next song under Up Next . Wait for it to play or tap it to go directly to the next song. Manage your station by tapping the three dots at the bottom of the screen while a song is playing and select Love or Dislike in the pop-up screen. You'll see a confirmation that your radio station will contain more music like the song that is playing (if you tap Love ) or less like it (if you tap Dislike ). Tap Radio to see your new station in the Recently Played section.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/using-itunes-radio-iphone-ipod-touch-1999208", "index": 1}
