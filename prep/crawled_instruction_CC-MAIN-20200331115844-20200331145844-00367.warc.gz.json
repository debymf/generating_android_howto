Reply Ted March 10, 2016 at 2:27 am I merged 5 calls tonight with my iPhone 5 running iOS 9, and it worked flawlessly just as described above. Amazing! Most user friendly conference call I've ever set up. Just worked! Love it! Reply Ben March 15, 2016 at 12:26 pm How do you individually disconnect callers while in a conference call with the iPhone 5s? Do I need an app Ted?? Reply Ted March 15, 2016 at 1:12 pm No app required Ben. As the article says above, all you do is: Talking Privately During a conference call, you can talk privately with one person during the conference or end a call. To do this, tap on the blue i button on the top-right. This can only be done when all the calls are merged. This article explains it all really well. I hope this helps. Good Luck! Ted Reply carl neger November 11, 2016 at 6:58 pm on my verizon iPhone 6 during conference call there is no blue I button to knock off one of the people in the conference . Is this feature only with ATAT and not verizon? Thanks in advance Anonymous February 26, 2016 at 9:16 am By following above mentioned points and using tools like R-HUB web conferencing servers, webex, gotomeeting, gomeetnow etc. one can effectively conduct conference calls. Reply Mario January 30, 2016 at 11:39 am yup, please submitt bug report to apple. crazy as it is, before at ios8 release it worked, then stopped....21 century, my God.Skype had it for ages. https://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html Reply Gary pulice December 25, 2015 at 10:13 pm Has anyone figured out why the merge button is greed out while trying to make conference call on FaceTime Reply Anonymous August 27, 2015 at 6:29 pm Yeah, this doesn't work. The \"merge\" button is greyed out and you can't merge the calls. You can only swap them. I've tried this from an iPhone, an iPad and 2 iPad Minis. All running versions of iOS 8. Reply Barbarrosa March 27, 2016 at 4:25 pm Same problem here. All the instructions above are of no use once the merge button is grayed. I have conducted conference calls with my iPhone before but now I can't. Is this a new bug of IOS 9?
