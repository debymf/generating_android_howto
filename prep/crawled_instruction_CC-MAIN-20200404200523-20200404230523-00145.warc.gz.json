Swipe up on the app you want to kill, as if you were throwing it off the screen.

On some Android devices, there's an exit button on the top right of each app when in this view, and you can tap it to close the app. If you see a three-lined button at the bottom with a small x on it, tap it to close all the recently opened apps. Repeat steps two and three to close any of the other running apps.
