Given good hardware that is not that old and does not have windows only crap devices in it... 1. Start with Linux Mint and the MATE version. Install it. Use it a while. 2. Get Debian stable and NOT Debian \"testing\". Testing is not the way to get the newest software. It is for reporting bugs no matter how stable it is sometimes. Yes the Debian way is harder the FIRST time and you must pick your parts; but now you can pick them similar to Linux Mint's with Mates fine work. You will have to simple set things to how you want them. 3. Debian stable have automatic SECURITY upgrades like none other. Do upgrades regularly and this can be automatic. 4. The way you handle needing a newer version is to get just a couple form Debian stable BACK-PORTS. Such as Firfox and Libre Office for BACK-PORTS. Once you do this everything upgrade the the best versions WHEN AND AS IT'S READY. This is a stable as you get and that means the least maintenance time after setup once. 5. All this is for smooth longevity and scalability should you need multiple systems. Scalability means you have one distro, one method, one set of packages (can vary per workstation need, I'm mainly talking about the base foundational core OS, UI and related base) across disparate hardware levels for more time saved and the fewest BUGS managing them. The stable version does not force a better reinstall periodically. The smooth tier version runs for about 2 years. Then and sometimes more importantly its the only one that can be upgraded to the new stable in place and work very well. Even then you can hold off 3 to 6 months and avoid practically any issues unless you hardware is extremely ancient and should be phased out and device/system upgraded. 6. Thing about Debian is it may piss you off on your very first install; but then you get why it is that way and it's simple for technical folks the second time. Mint is like fast food and Debian stable is like the grocer store. It's for cooks. 7. Window similar UI element is not \"borrowing\" from Windows. Windows did not invent them. Some are afraid people can't understand GNU/Linux is not Windows. But I have no problem optionally making it look like Windows (whichever version) and have screen element placement and functions exactly where YOU want them. I don't even care if you want the same bootleg icons, or Apples. You can mix and do whatever you want! You should. I think Mate (and others are fine) allows maximal interface choice AND run lean not bloated. It has more legacy which in this case means robustness and stability longer worked on. Mainly Mate has all the little matching OS/UI helper apps; that stay the heck out of your way and are an absolute requirement. I personally prefer the \"Applications/Places/System\" menu buttons, (and one bottom panel optionally) as you really get used to those fast. There not a lot of user interface acclimation to do when new users are coming from Windows. People already know. In conclusion the Debian packages and management system has no rival. This is 'pure' Debian. Meaning your get the stable security upgrades before anything. All your critical programs are already compiled for you in the Debian system and not Ubuntu packaging. There's more stuff. New programs start here first. You never have to compile; but it's easy to do; for any custom or unpopular needs. It the very heart of Linux and just works. Depending on your choice combination. I suggest ONLY installing what you need on Debian stable and trying out many distros on another install. This is the one to depend upon. Reply Adrien H. December 18, 2016 at 2:01 pm I'm still hesitant on what to choose. I've used a lot Fedora and Ubuntu as the first was installed on my work computer and the second was advised to me as a simple to use distro (7 year ago). Now I've encountered severe problems with the last Ubuntu release (why did I have to jump on it... Damn me) and decided it was the time to take a look elsewhere. I've installed Debian with KDE but I'm not sure that was the best choice. I thought it would be a good choice because I'm proficient with the command line (I always prefer console tools over graphical counterparts) and doesn't have a pronounced taste for last features but it looks a bit too naked out of the box and I don't feel like spending too much time setting it up. Or maybe it doesn't need too much effort to have something suitable to my tastes ? My main use is software development using IDE's (Netbeans, Android Studio, PHPStorm, Apache, MySQL, PHPMyAdmin, a console (XTerm) and a console text editor (neovim)). What distro would you recommand to someone having a good experience with Linux, bash, console tools but doesn't want to spend too much time setting it up?

Reply Anonymous August 28, 2015 at 9:55 am I have conflicting views. I like both Xfce and Plasma 5 the two desktops that are the least likely to find at the same distro. Also I'm unable to find many distributions with Plasma 5 with the worst being linux mint and their stability obsessiness. As for what distro I would prefer, I would take anything with pacman on it.

Today is the first time I've ever installed Linux on anything, and I'm happy to say mint/cinnamon installed without a hitch on my test box :) Now ... Thanks for all this info, to you and your commenters :) I have more than 10, older than 4 year old lenovo desktops getting ready to go to a school in Fiji that has nothing - sometimes no power and likely not much internet, if any. Any and all recommendations for a quick and easy install that will give the students and the teachers - some of which may have never seen a computer - something they can use to increase learning, without having to learn about computers. For example - the terminal is not something they're going to *need*, but there are probably a couple of students that may muck around with it (and maybe build a new dist one day :o ) I was pretty impressed with the suite that came with mint, but you may know something more suited to schools, and if you do I want to hear it please ... Thinking about: * 5 year olds: think tux paint, starfall, rainforest maths, 2 of those suggestions need internet which they don't have ... * 8 year olds: video recording & editing, writing, photographing their artwork and editing it, blogging in a world with limited internet * 10 year olds: everything I've said times 100, and scratch or similar (locally installed) * 12 year olds - somewhere to write, explore, experiment * 14 year olds - consumers or creators? * all ages - getting connected in a place where connections are limited and so it goes ... These kids and their teachers haven't had computers before so if everything just worked when they plug them in and turn them on that would be great. Its all sounding very 'Sugata Mitra' ... If there's a distro suited to that - I'd love to hear about it - huge thanks for anything you suggest to support this small project :) Reply john April 5, 2015 at 8:10 am you need tahrpup, a tiny linux that shares ubuntu kernel and repo, use puppy pakage manager to get edubuntu learning game suites like G compris. build the distro from inside the OS and save back to disc. easy, it also has a one click install software repo of its own on the desktop, with librecad,gimp, blender, mixx, lmms, etc. for older kids. .runs inside 130mb of ram, loaded from cd or usb, no hard drive required. lighter, faster and more versatile and user friendly than those above. Reply Anonymous June 8, 2015 at 4:37 pm Install Lubuntu 14.04 with and unencrypted home folder and the lvm option clicked on. It's the most lightweight of the Ubuntu flavors, so you can install the Ubuntu Software Center without any hassle. Get that from the Lubuntu Software Center. Once you have Ubuntu Software Center, use it to add all LibreOffice packages and the Edubuntu stuff. Add Timeshift via the command line and make a snapshot for backup (this program is like restore points in Windows and it comes in handy). These are the commands to install Timeshift, and this is the only time you need to use the terminal: sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:teejee2008/ppa sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install timeshift Just copy and paste them in there and the password when prompted of course. Here is the link for that program: http://www.teejeetech.in/p/timeshift.html That's an easy install of a lightweight Ubuntu flavor. My 2005 Dell ran like a top when I installed it. It's Ubuntu with a traditional desktop that doesn't use much in the way of resources. There's a lot of support in Ubuntu forums and it's very easy to use. And USC is the best software center IMO. To summarize: Install with LVM. Update. Install USC. Add the Edubuntu stuff. (I'd also add LibreOffice and get Google Chrome instead of Firefox.) Timeshift for backup. Might want to change the wallpaper too. It's not pretty out of the box. Your installs should take about a half hour each.

I know this is a year-old question, but the Internet is timeless; someone else will come across this, seeking an answer to the same question. Reply lp March 9, 2015 at 12:01 pm Precise Puppy can run the whole OS from Ram - lightning fast! Reply Colonel Angus March 8, 2015 at 5:53 pm Netrunner is a very nice distro, as well. Reply Riley Mullins March 8, 2015 at 2:10 am I went with LXDE on a Dell Latitude D620 that a client was going to toss out. Bought the internal Bluetooth card ($5) and a battery ($35), then installed an 80GB Crucial SSD that I had that was doing nothing and maxed out the RAM. This setup, boots up to the desktop in under 4 seconds. Reply Kenneth DeVries March 7, 2015 at 5:03 pm I have tried a LOT of distros, and ultimately came back to Xubuntu. I refurbish and rebuild laptops at Free Geek here in Portland OR, and we install Mint because it is similar enough to Windows that new users don't have much of a learning curve, but by direct comparison I still take Xubuntu. It's very stable and flexible, it updates frequently - sometimes daily, and the killer feature for me is its outstanding right-click menu, which gives you everything you would get from clicking the menu button in the corner of Mint or Windows - direct access to all applications and settings with one click on the desktop. When I right-click in Mint I can create a new folder. I use Cairo-dock which has the option of putting Mac-style popup docks on three sides of the window and a simple Conky desktop calendar and clock. There are also some very useful keystroke application launchers like Launchy, which can reduce reliance on the mouse, for those of us on the brink of carpal tunnel syndrome. In general Xubuntu is more Mac than Windows, but with the added Linux functionality of multiple workspaces - as many as you want. For people who don't fiddle much with their system, when transitioning from Windows, Mint is probably the best, but from Mac I suggest one of the buntus. Reply Kenneth DeVries March 7, 2015 at 5:40 pm I also run the same setup on a Dell Inspiron Mini, which hardly has any brains at all. It runs noticeably slower - things take a couple of seconds instead of happening instantly, and nobody supports that model's quirky graphics card any more, but otherwise it's a fully functional system that was completely crippled by ever-expanding Windows updates. Reply Von Adam Martinez March 7, 2015 at 3:28 pm I have Windows and Linux Mint on my desktop(dual boot). I only use windows whenever I got to use my desktop after lending it to my girl friend. Reply Dan March 6, 2015 at 11:06 pm When in doubt, use LinuxMint MATE. It is drop-dead easy. Once you've had your taste of Linux (including the use of the Terminal and editing oddly located configuration files) then you can venture out to the other distros. I've tried ElementaryOS and it also feels simple-to-use. It's like a child's OS that mimics OSX's interface. Reply Simen B March 6, 2015 at 4:53 pm For trying out distros from USB, I'd recommend a Windows app called YUMI. It let's you load any number of distros onto the same USB stick, so you don't have to go through the whole reformat+write process all the time. (I think the site is called pemdrivelinux.com, but I'm not 100% sure) I'm currently on Ubuntu/Unity, but I'm considering to make the jump over to Fedora. Also, I've always wanted to try setting up Arch, but I think I'll keep that project in a VM for well, obvious reasons.

It's a win-win - you get to keep using your system, and we're not having another compromised machine sending out spam and viruses to us. Reply kt March 6, 2015 at 4:20 pm Great article and I agree with everything you said. You could have added pclinuxos to the list, because it's a rolling release and has mate, kde, and cinnamon, you have a lot of flexibility. Switching from mint to pclinuxos takes a little homework, mainly going from .deb to .rpm packages. Reply Lamees March 6, 2015 at 4:18 pm I thought you choose a ditro first then change the desktop environment, right?! Reply Doc March 8, 2015 at 4:39 am Most common combinations of distro and desktop environment can be found as a distro - Linux Mint, for example, is a combination of Ubuntu and Cinnamon/MATE. Xubuntu is Ubuntu with XFCE desktop manager. You can always do things yourself - install Ubuntu then install Cinnamon, then switch desktop managers - but then you wouldn't have Mint's pre-installed (non-free) codecs, which can be considered a plus by some. Reply Danny Stieben March 31, 2015 at 11:10 pm You can, but if you have multiple desktop environments installed on your system you'll see the all of the specific programs and settings for each one -- they don't hide if you use the other DE. It's much cleaner and simpler to do it this way, but of course at the end of the day it's always your choice. Reply Lamees March 6, 2015 at 4:16 pm Linux newbie here, tried a virtual machine first then did a clean Ubuntu installation. Using an old pc so changed a few desktop environments because unity was too slow. Wait, xubuntu is a desktop environment or a distro? Currently using xfce for its lightness. love finding problems and learning to fix them myself. Reply Tondar March 7, 2015 at 11:34 pm xubuntu is a distrospin from ubuntu. It's basically ubuntu with xfce as default desktop environment. Reply", "url": "https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/distro-indecision-cheats-guide-choosing-linux-distribution/", "index": 0}
