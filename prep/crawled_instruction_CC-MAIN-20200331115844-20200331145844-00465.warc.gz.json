Reply Jay Coven January 20, 2019 at 11:51 am I'm an Amazon Prime member. I'd say that about 10% of Amazon's music are not* the original versions. Same acts, but different versions. I'd say 50% of the songs I'm looking for are considered \"samples,\" meaning they are faded in and then faded out, after about 40 seconds of play. They are introduced as samples. Since there's no explanation of the above from Amazon, I won't pay for a better Amazon music plan. Reply John January 20, 2019 at 9:43 am Seriously! No Google Music.

The only issues I have with Google Play Music are the interface (no dark/night mode) and the podcast support (manual playlists and no automatic \"unplayed\" playlist). Reply James H. January 19, 2019 at 9:29 pm I had a three month free subscription to Apple Music and went back to Spotify Premium after two weeks. The reason why: Apple music would not let me play from my phone or iPad onto my various connected speakers. On Spotify, it's dead simple to choose any Bluetooth connected device, on Apple, it's impossible, it has to be Airplay only. Apple helpdesk confirmed this.

Reply Chris April 7, 2018 at 2:21 pm Have only ever used Amazon Music Unlimited and am disappointed. I sense they are planning to discontinue the service in 2019. 1. Songs randomly become unavailable (without any sort of alert or unavailable list) so you have to manually comb through your playlists every now and again to replace them with different versions of the songs. This should either not happen or the service should do a replacement automatically. 2. They've stopped their upload feature and I've read that they will purge grandfathered content early 2019. For those like me that have rare MP3s not offered with their service and like to mix them in your playlists. 3. No smart playlists (for example having young kids, I manage a Clean List and an Explicit list and would like a Smart List to be the combination of both; similar to iTunes) 4. I understand they have only about a quarter of the selections as Spotify & others (~3M compared to ~12M) Perhaps the other services have these same problems. For those that know, please reply validating or nullifying if I should switch or stick with Amazon. Reply Pete June 30, 2018 at 11:13 am All music streaming services are subject to the random disappearance of songs. This is is actually beyond the control of the service provider. Typically this is caused by the publishers/artists and their respective contracts or decisions. Reply Chris September 21, 2018 at 2:23 pm Thanks for the comment Pete. Are you or anyone aware of any of the service that's smart enough to automatically replace with a working version? Reply Mr Shad December 2, 2018 at 11:28 am Fully agree Amazon deleting songs on my playlist is nonsense, my soul playlist had 30 songs deleted out of 100. Even for example the best of Bruce Springsteen was deleted as a new best of was released. I don t get that with other services and the range of music isn t that diverse. Reply John Volvich March 19, 2018 at 11:44 am You can try MusConv tool. Reply Peter Black March 16, 2018 at 8:04 am I had a great experience with Amazon Music Unlimited on Android device.

I have been and still trying to figure out which one is the best for me. I have an Amazon Fire HE 8, and a second one in the household, and then I also have an iPhone, an iPad pro and an Apple Tv 3 and finally my laptop is Windows based. The rest of the household have 3 iPads, another iPhone,and 2 MacBook Airs, another Apple tv 2 and the new Apple tv generation 4. This was a very informative post. Yet I feel like it didn't cover all of the choices that are available. I am open to any more suggestions on this. Thank you for your time and I hope that you have a wonderful day! Reply Mish January 26, 2018 at 10:17 pm I have been a Spotify fan and subscriber for years. It serves our multi-generation family perfectly. My individual membership still works for us. I have first priority, and the number two position rotates monthly to each of my two young-adult children. We each have a playlist folder with our name, therefore making it easier to find \"our\" songs and artists. Spotify is easily paired with home audio receivers, smart tv's, and of course, Alexa. I have no idea which music streaming company has the largest music catalogue, but we are as diverse as a family can be in our music preferances, and we are all happy with Spotify. Although I am a Amazon Prime member, I will stay with Spotify. \"If it ain't broke don't fix it\"! To each his own, multiple music streaming providers competing for customers serves each of us well in both financial savings, and genres of music offered. Reply michaelson of jack November 22, 2017 at 8:52 pm Amazon is for those who might enjoy music and think all music genres follow under \"POP\" as in popular. I don't recommend it for those who are musically inclined and love music. I have Prime and Unlimited music streaming [which is very slow] ... But fear I am missing my Jazz guitarists and independent songwriters that Spotify will give me; therefore I might switch in a few months from now. I am switching back to a apple computer soon too [from my surface], so i-tunes will help me find some downloadable songs. Reply Bangelica October 13, 2017 at 12:07 pm For those who wants to transfer their music playlist you might wanna try checking out musconv.com it helps transfer music playlist from one service to another - Bangelica Reply Mike September 16, 2017 at 2:04 pm I am bery happy with Spotify. I have used streaming on demand services for over a decade. I used to be with Rhapsody for many years. I switched to Spotify because of the great family plan that others have. They offer 320kbs playback which was highest than others when I signed up. As far as versatility, I have Alexa hooked into it and Bluetoothed to my hi quality Ediphiers. So with Spotify I can say \"Alexa play (song title)\" or \"Alexa play (particular playlist) from Spotify.\" It's integrated in my home theatre and my car obviously. I'm very happy with it but it's up to each person's desires to determine what's best for them. Just to emphasize Alexa is fully integrated with Alexa. Reply Mr. B August 19, 2017 at 6:44 pm I didnt see anything about fidelity here. Only Pandora offers improved fidleity with their payed service. My initial impressions of Amazon's basic Prime service was that the Sound quality was poor. More recently I haven't noticed that, so maybe they've improved it or maybe I just happen to be listening to better recorded source material. Reply Davthomp July 14, 2017 at 3:24 pm I started with Spotify, and loved it, and miss it. I had let my two teenage boys have access to it, but after far to many times while on a run, my playlist would get commandeered by one of them. The problem at the time was Spotify only had individual memberships, and Apple Music came out the the family plan. So I switched to the Apple Music Family plan as it was cheaper than three individual Spotify plans. Spotify finally offered a family plan, but we had all built up our playlists and didn't want to switch back again. What I miss about Spotify is finding new music. New music is dramatically easier to find on Spotify. Reply Ed Edwards May 21, 2017 at 6:53 pm Coming from paid Slacker account for close to two years, I wanted to stream line the whole family's music source. With two teens and a wife, we listen to music a lot. My preference is in finding new music artists in the various genres I listen to. Loved the 80 hair bands, but loved finding the undiscovered bands of that era more and continue to enjoy doing it. The kids are hip hop with some sprinklings of 80's pop-rock (journey, etc). I love the idea of banning a song or artist and never, ever, ever hearing them again on my phone. Since I am primarily in discovery mode, this is a nice luxury. The rest of the fam had Apple music as they all had Apple products. Fast forward to 2017 and we have 3 androids and one I Phone. Time to stop paying $19 for music and consolidate. I tried Spotify free, Amazon paid (1 month trial) and was going to commit to Amazon. I like the lyrics feature, the quick feedback customer service, and like most of the rest, the selection of music. After much browbeating from my lone Apple-ite and her informing me we can use Apple Music on Android, I decided to try that for a month and installed it on mine and my wife's phones. Needless to say, Apple on android is probably illegal in some countries and from my experience, it should be in all. Here's what I found wrong with Apple music for Android: 1. No landscape mode for app. In my car, using Google maps, my phone is in landscape 100% of the time. The Apple app sits in portrait the whole time forcing me to tilt my head to sometimes read the band I just \"discovered\". Want to read lyrics this way? Good luck. 2. Skip/dislike/thumbs down/etc: - It's a 3 step process. Click the 3 dots at bottom, then dislike the song and Apple will tell you they will try not to play stuff like this any more. A lie I'll address next. Unfortunately, you are still forced to listen to the song you already made pretty clear you dislike until you hit skip. 3. Didn't like that song on the \"created station\"? Well, stay tuned because it will show up again the next time you want to play that station again. Go to the dislike button and lo and behold, it's already selected red as if it knows you don't like this song. If you know I don't like it, why am I paying to hear it again? 4. Pause the song on a station to do another task (co-worker/gym rat/rob bank)? Or get out of your car and go inside and pick up where you left off? Nope. The song is gone, blank screen with play button that does nothing. You must exit/back out of the player to reselect the station and it starts a new song. In all fairness this is an App based issue and perhaps does not belong, but if any Android readers are here (I was), please consider these shortcomings before jumping in to Apple music. Reply Josh December 21, 2017 at 9:28 pm Agree, the Apple Music app on Android is awful. Totally different than on iPhone. Slacker however has been my favorite for close to 10 years. Since back when they had their own hardware. I have written them several times saying I will leave Apple Music in a heartbeat if they'd offer a family plan, but they don't and it's a shame. Reply Alex March 29, 2017 at 2:16 am Wow people, the article's title is pretty clear as to what services is comparing. It doesn't say \"review of all paid music streaming services\" great that you like google, then write an article about it! Thanks for this article, it was VERY informative! Reply buzz April 19, 2017 at 7:43 pm Agreed. I was going to point that out but you beat me to it. Reply Lee Malone January 19, 2019 at 5:52 pm That is the problem though, it should compare all services to be believed. Otherwise it might seem like shilling for one or all of the few compared. Personally, I think Soundcloud is the best, and at least on par with those reviewed here. Reply Brian Sandridge February 9, 2017 at 1:05 am Why does Amazon Music play louder and w better sound than Apple Music? Reply Ender February 2, 2017 at 4:57 pm Google Music is the best in my opinion. Best interface / apps, best prediction / discovery, allows uploading personal collection to cloud for streaming from any device, bundled YouTube Red + YouTube Music, pays artists the most, etc.. Reply Bryan Wolfe January 28, 2017 at 3:42 pm We'll definitely examine Google Music at a later day. Thanks to the awesome comments. Reply David Styles January 18, 2017 at 11:31 am Amazon Prime Unlimited because as well as the same as all the others you can additionally use your voice via the Amazon Echo devices to play music, much faster than typing and you don't need a phone, tablet or P.C. On to use it. Use an Echo Dot and Bluetooth link it to good hi fi speakers via an aptx dongle or active speakers and the system is unbeatable. Finally pay an annual fee and it is far cheaper than all the other services. Reply Tom January 12, 2017 at 10:34 pm Like so many others have pointed-out, I'm shocked you intentionally omitted Google Play Music. While none of the services are perfect, GPM has been the best for me, and I've been a (paid) subscriber for years. I dumped Spotify when they couldn't get their act together with radio. I could be listening to jazz for an hour, and they'd suddenly give me a rap song... Hours into Beethoven & Bach, and they'd randomly inject hip-hop. Google seems to really have their act together when it comes to understanding my likes, and moods, and they figured-out (the first few days) that I'm not into rap or hip-hop -- something that seems to confound Spotify. Add to that the fact I can upload up-to 50,000 of my own tracks, and listen anywhere, on a ny device (it's completely platform-agnostic) and the service is a no-brainer. Reply likefunbutnot January 12, 2017 at 10:15 pm My problem with more or less all streaming services is the incredibly poor way they handle classical music. The services themselves have incorrect meta-data or use non-uniform sources, so it's very common to find albums or tracks misidentified because the services don't discriminate between the \"Artist\", \"Album Artist\" and \"Composer\" information, or because there's no official album title or a title that's entirely duplicated like \"Herbert von Karajon Conducts Beethoven's 9th Symphony\" (classical albums are really more accurately discussed by their publisher's catalog number; what we computer people like to call a \"primary key\") and every music database calls it something different. This is endlessly aggravating and renders more or less all mainstream streaming music services useless. It's also not going to be fixed, because the people who run the services and the databases they rely on don't give a shit what classical music people want. Services that cater to classical music fans on the other hand are incredibly expensive and will pretty much never have the support of mainstream devices, so we're left with our nerd options of maintaining a giant, self-organized library as a solitary pursuit or just giving up and accepting that everything sucks and is wrong. Reply Kobela January 23, 2017 at 6:17 am Wow, I had this same argument in my DBA class, mainly regarding building a database that included artists cover songs. We never did decide the right way to build it, so I ended up conceding my points since it was just a class project. Reply qanik April 27, 2017 at 6:21 am agree 100% and even more so - so what service do you find that is tolerable Reply likefunbutnot April 27, 2017 at 3:38 pm @Qanik, At one time, I was paying the $300/year charged for the Naxos Music Library. That's insanely expensive compared to other services, but it also worked vastly better than things like Play Music. At the moment, I use Amazon and very deliberately avoid using it for classical music, choosing jazz or movie soundtracks instead since those things are not typically mislabeled by Amazon's database. I hope that one of the services will get better and I can say that Amazon has at least given me better and more useful feedback about my complaints than I got from Google. Reply Dan Fein January 12, 2017 at 8:41 pm It's about time Spotify will fix their shuffle play. It doesn't really shuffle your Playlist. Spotify neglects hundreds of requests to fix it in their support forum. This is very disturbing. Reply Erin January 12, 2017 at 8:29 pm I also use Google Play Music. I enjoy it a lot, especially since it also comes with YouTube Red. I also have tons of my own music uploaded to Google. I used the free version for a long while, but I got tired of the ads. Google Play Music also has a free 90-day trial. I'll be honest, I had every intention of cancelling after the free trial, but the lack of ads on Google Play Music and YouTube convinced me to pay for it. Plus, I like to listen to the music through my Chromecast. Reply Dimitri January 12, 2017 at 12:17 pm You should mention that either Apple or Amazon doesn't support Chromecast, and it's a deal breaker for me. I personally use the new Napster app from Rhapsody and it's fantastic. Same 9.99$ Reply Mediamark January 12, 2017 at 4:31 am I recently stumbled upon Amazon Prime Music and so far am enjoying it.

Reply kringler January 11, 2017 at 7:52 pm I'm still shocked that Google Play Music isn't included in the article. It comes with YouTube Red, which is a nice bonus, is essentially the same price, has a free, nifty 3rd party desktop app, has a music selection that doesn't seem far off from Spotify, and I greatly, greatly enjoy it's playlists far more than Spotify's.

Reply Gary January 11, 2017 at 4:29 pm Since I have Prime I started using the basic Amazon music. Previously used Pandora and podcasts. I switched to the new Amazon music unlimited recently when they were offering the $20 credit and free month. Get a lot more music that I could not get before. I prefer to download all to my SD card rather than stream. This way, my entire family(up to 10 devices) can use the service, since only one device is allowed to stream at a time. Is this the best service? Maybe, maybe not. It suits my needs and I already have it included anyhow and the extra $70? per year for more music isn't a big hit.
