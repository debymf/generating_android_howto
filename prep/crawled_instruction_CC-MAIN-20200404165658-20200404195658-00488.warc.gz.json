Prices are usually cheaper online, and eBay is known for good deals, but there are some deals that should raise a red flag. Some scam sellers make new accounts to list very valuable items for enormous discounts. These items could be counterfeit, broken, or stolen, and the seller will describe them as new. Do more investigating if you see deals that seem too good to be true. [6] For example, you might see a seller offering a new iPhone for significantly cheaper than all the other iPhones on eBay. This is a red flag, and you should question why a seller could offer a new iPhone so far below the normal market price. It is an even bigger red flag if the account has few or no reviews. Very cheap items are not necessarily a negative thing. Someone may be moving soon and just has to get rid of items fast. But it is a reason to do more investigating. Image titled Find Reliable Sellers on eBay Step 7 2 Use caution if the item picture is a stock photo. eBay allows sellers to upload their own photos of the item they're selling. If they upload a stock photo from a website or the product manufacturer, this is a red flag because they may be trying to hide the actual condition of their item. If you see an item using a generic stock photo, look into the seller's feedback to ensure that they are reputable. [7] This is especially important for used and collectible items when the condition is very important. If you can't see the actual item for sale, there is a chance it's damaged or not in the condition that the user is describing. Image titled Find Reliable Sellers on eBay Step 8 3 Check if the seller has listed similar items on their profile. In a seller s feedback profile, scroll down to find the Items for Sale section. Click See all to get a list of all other items that this seller is listing. If a seller has a lot of items in the same category, it indicates that this seller has a specialty. This is a good sign. Sellers that specialize in one category are usually professionals and take selling very seriously. They will work hard to deliver your items and handle any issues that arise. [8] Having a lot of different items is, again, not necessarily a negative thing. People often use eBay to clean out their garages and homes, and naturally have many diverse items for sale. But this usually means they aren t professional sellers and might be less skilled or willing to deliver the best service possible. Having one high-value item for sale and nothing else is a bigger red flag. This could be a fake seller profile that someone is using to unload damaged products. Image titled Find Reliable Sellers on eBay Step 9 4 Ask the seller a question about the item if you re suspicious. If you have any uncertainties about a product or a seller, contact them through eBay. Click the Ask a Question option on the product page to contact the seller. Request more information about the product or its price if you have any doubts. If the seller delays or dodges your question, avoid this item. [9] See how fast and completely the seller answers your question. A good guideline is that reputable sellers respond within 24 hours, or 48 hours if you contacted them on a weekend or holiday. A seller with slow communication may be less reliable. Image titled Find Reliable Sellers on eBay Step 10 5 Avoid completing transactions outside of eBay. If a seller asks you to leave eBay and buy their item from another site, or contact them directly off of eBay s communication channel, do not buy the item. Once you leave eBay, you re no longer covered by their money-back guarantee. Scam sellers try to get people away from the main site so buyers won t be able to get their money back. Never listen to a seller who tells you to do this. [10] Asking buyers to complete transactions off of eBay is a violation of the site s policy. If a seller asks you to do this, report them to eBay.
