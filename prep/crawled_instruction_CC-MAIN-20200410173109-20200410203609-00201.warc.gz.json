App Logo Google Play Initialize the App Open the app the initial loading will take a little longer, but hand in there.

From here simply tap on the Live TV option to get to the channel list. You will be presented with a ton of options to choose from. There are some really interesting channels in this app. But unfortunately there are no network ones, but that is not a big deal if you are looking to spend some quality time. How to watch live TV on Android Channel Options Use the App to Watch Live TV Select the channel which fancies your mood and simply give it a tap. We are aware that some channels are not available in some regions, so if something is not working simply move on to another one. With around 500 plus channels there is no shortage of great content. How to watch live TV on Android Channels After you clicked on a channel, the video will start buffering. The buffering is usually short on WiFi but can take longer depending on your internet speed and signal strength. Some channels take a little longer than others to initialize so be patient. How to watch live TV on Android Loading Screen Use the Live TV Interface The app uses a basic interface which can be seen in the screen captures. There are a pause button and definition options. Some TV channels can also be forwarded to a certain point, which is a great feature to get to the juicy parts of the show. How to watch live TV on Android Overall the app has a satisfactory interface, however, there is one annoying thing the pause button overstays its welcome for way too long. No one likes a big pause symbol right in the middle of a screen while there is some action going on in the video. The video controls also take a tad bit longer to vanish from the screen, it is not that big of a deal though and is certainly a personal qualm.
