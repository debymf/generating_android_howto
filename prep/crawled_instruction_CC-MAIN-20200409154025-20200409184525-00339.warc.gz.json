When the logo appears, let go of the button. Move the iPhone and Apple Watch close to each other. Since pairing an Apple Watch to an iPhone uses Bluetooth, the devices must be near each other for the connection to work. On your iPhone, open the Apple Watch app and tap Start Pairing . When the iPhone and Apple Watch detect each other, a swirling animation appears on the Apple Watch screen. A frame appears on the iPhone screen. Move the iPhone so that the Apple Watch appears in the frame on the iPhone. When the iPhone \"locks\" onto the Watch, you'll move automatically to the next step. When your iPhone and Apple Watch are paired, you can choose to Restore from Backup or Set Up as New Apple Watch . If you've had an Apple Watch in the past and want to use the data from that, choose Restore. Otherwise, choose Set Up as New. Continue on to one of the next two sections of this article, based on your choice in the last step.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/set-up-apple-watch-4589317", "index": 0}

Agree to Apple's terms and conditions, wait for the Watch app to sign you into your Apple ID account (if you're prompted to sign in, do so), and then tap OK on the Shared Settings screen. Next, you can create a passcode to secure your Apple Watch. This is just like the passcode on your iPhone . To use a basic, 4-digit code, tap Create a Passcode and enter your preferred code twice on the Apple Watch. To use a more complex and secure code, tap Add a Long Passcode and enter the code on the Watch. You can also choose Don't Add Passcode , but we recommend against that. The Watch app on the iPhone then lets you know about the Heart Health features of the Apple Watch, for models that support them. There's nothing to do on this screen other than tap Continue . All of the heart health features are used only on the Watch, after set up. The Apple Watch supports Apple Pay for easy, secure wireless payments. If you already use Apple Pay on your iPhone, you'll just need to re-authorize your card. If you don't use it yet, you can set it up in this step. Either choose Continue to set up Apple Pay or Set Up Later in the Apple Watch App . The next screen explains the safety features of the Apple Watch (the exact options differ based on the model, but they include Emergency SOS calls and fall detection). Your Watch inherits many settings from your iPhone. If you've already set up things like emergency contacts and health and activity goals, those settings will be automatically added to your Watch. If not, you may be prompted to set them up here. If your Apple Watch supports cellular connectivity, you can configure cellular service at this point. Tap Set Up Cellular . This brings you to a set-up process for the phone company providing cellular service for your Watch. Follow the onscreen prompts until you return to a screen that says Cellular Is Ready . Tap Continue . You can install Apple Watch apps that give you mini-versions of iPhone apps right on your wrist. On this screen, you can choose to either Install All Watch apps available on your iPhone or Choose Later . With all of your settings selected, your iPhone and Apple Watch will begin to sync. How long this takes depends on how much content you're syncing, but expect it to take at least a few minutes. Check the progress wheel on both the iPhone and Watch for status. A noise will play to let you know when the process if complete. While you wait, you can learn more about the Watch by swiping up on its screen and tapping tutorials. When the sound and vibration let you know that syncing is done, press the Watch's Digital Crown to start using it.", "url": "https://www.lifewire.com/set-up-apple-watch-4589317", "index": 1}

The Watch app on the iPhone will show you all of the available backups. Just tap the one you want. The first few screens after choosing a backup are pretty quick. Agree to Apple's terms and conditions, sign into your Apple ID (this should happen automatically, but sign into if you're asked). Tap OK on the Shared Settings screen to continue. Next, create a passcode. Tap Create a Passcode to use a simple, 4-digit code to secure your Watch. Enter the code you want twice on the Watch. Tap Add a Long Passcode to use a more complex code, or tap Don't Add Passcode to skip it entirely (but that's not a good security habit and we don't recommend it). If your Apple Watch supports Heart Health features, the next screen details them. There's nothing to do here except read about the features and then tap Continue . You can add Apple Pay to your Watch, if you want. Either tap Continue to set up Apple Pay or Set Up Later in the Apple Watch App to do it later. At this point, your iPhone and Apple Watch start syncing. This will take anywhere for a minute or two to much longer, depending on how much data is being synced. A wheel displays progress on both the iPhone and Watch. A noise plays and the Watch vibrates to let you know that syncing is finished and that you can start using your Watch.
