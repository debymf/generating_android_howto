Reply Doggiebones February 18, 2018 at 6:23 am The tap anywhere to take picture works for the front camera but not the rear camera. This was a feature in the note 4. Thanks Samsung for being a dog eating Korean and using dog shit to build phones. Wtf Reply ACB23 January 15, 2018 at 4:57 pm You will notice that these \"special features\" mostly affect software, like software button reordering, which can be done on any device with proper software. If you write an app for it you'll be able to use this feature on other Android devices too. Another example is floating camera button, which is app dependant and no matter if you have Samsung or not, as long as you have apk and modified build.prop file you can use it on any phone. I don't want to push it too far but these \"feature-candy\" things are actually only marketing strategy. It brings nothing earth-shaking to end-users. Android is an open system so you can change almost everything, on any device. Reply", "url": "https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/samsung-galaxy-s8-note-8-features/", "index": 0}
